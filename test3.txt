UIO - User Interface Organizer 0.0.0-2.09
====================================================
By jazzisparis for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[b][size=3]User Interface Organizer, or UIO, is an NVSE-powered plugin that is designed to manage and maintain all UI/HUD extensions added to the game by various mods. Once installed, UIO will ensure UI extensions are always properly installed and, when necessary, properly removed; it will automatically detect, resolve and prevent UI-related issues, and will help keep the game's UI intact. You will be able to safely install/remove UI mods, at any time, without having to worry about it breaking other UI mods, or worse - the game.
<br />
<br />UIO currently supports all UI mods that are known to me and require support (a full list can be found below). Adding support for unlisted/future mods is very simple, can be done by anyone, and does not require updating UIO, or involving me in any way. For instructions see below.
<br />
<br />UIO also makes it possible to install any supported UI mod [i]manually[/i] (i.e. by a simple files-to-folders extraction), without running any [i]scripted installer[/i] (most UI mods use scripted installers in order to modify one or more of the game's UI files. These installers are known to fail on some machines, and may break other mods when uninstalled).
<br />[/size]
<br />[center]
<br />[youtube]qSA2BFQ2zc4[/youtube][/center][line]
<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=3]How does UIO work?[/size][/color]
<br />[size=2]UIO operates at game launch, before any UI files are loaded in memory. It detects installed UI mods, makes sure every valid UI extension is properly registered, removes references to missing files and duplicate entries. All this is done without modifying any game files.[/size]
<br />
<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=3]How do I use UIO?[/size][/color]
<br />[size=2]Simply download and install it using NMM/FOMM, or manually extract (use [url=http://www.7-zip.org]7-Zip[/url]) the 7z archive into the game's 'Data' folder. Please note that this is an NVSE plugin, not a standard mod - it doesn't include an ESP/ESM file and will therefore not show in your load-order.[/size]
<br />
<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=3]UIO and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334]Mod Organizer[/url] (MO)[/size][/color]
<br />[size=2]Due to the way MO works, installing/removing/getting UI mods to work together in harmony, can be very tricky. This is no longer an issue when using UIO alongside MO - UI mods can be treated and handled exactly the same way as any "standard" mods.[/size]
<br />
<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=3]What about [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/38961]Unified HUD[/url]?[/size][/color]
<br />[size=2]Technically, with UIO installed, you won't ever have to use Unified HUD.

<br />[/b][/url][b][size=2][line][/size]
<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=3]Adding support for a mod[/size][/color]
<br />[size=2]
<br />In order to make UIO recognize and support your mod, you need to create a text file containing your mod's details and place it in the appropriate folder:
<br />[/size]
<br />[size=2]1. Open the folder [color=#00ff00]..&#92;data&#92;uio&#92;public&#92;[/color].
<br />[/size]
<br />[size=2]2. Create a plain text file (use your mod's name as the file name) and open it.
<br />[/size]
<br />[size=2]3. The file's structure should be as follows:
<br />
<br />[u]Line #1[/u]: Should be composed of the following parts, in [u]successive order[/u] and with [u]no spaces[/u]:
<br />1. The path to your XML file, relative to [color=#00ff00]..&#92;Data&#92;Menus&#92;Prefabs&#92;[/color]
<br />2. [color=#00ff00]::[/color] (double colon)
<br />3. The target XML, which can be denoted in one of two ways:
<br />a) A [u]name[/u] of a valid game menu (ex: [color=#ffe599]HUDMainMenu[/color], [color=#ffe599]ContainerMenu[/color], etc.), or
<br />b) A [u]path[/u] to an XML file, prefixed by [color=#00ff00]@[/color] (ex: [color=#ffe599]@globals.xml[/color], [color=#ffe599]@prefabs&#92;text_box.xml[/color], etc.).
<br />4. [color=#00ff00]::[/color] (double colon)
<br />5. The [u]name[/u] of the [u]UI component[/u] in the XML, to which your file should be injected.
<br />
<br />[u]Line #2[/u]: This line is used for conditions - when to/when not to install the extension. Complex conditions can be used, but will not be covered here (PM if you need to use conditions). In most cases, just leave it [color=#00ff00]true[/color].
<br />
<br />Examples:
<br />
<br />[color=#ffe599]pnx&#92;pnxhud.xml::HUDMainMenu::HUDMainMenu
<br />true
<br />
<br />pnx&#92;pnxhud.xml::@main&#92;hud_main_menu.xml::HUDMainMenu
<br />true
<br />
<br />WMM&#92;WMM.xml::InventoryMenu::GLOW_BRANCH
<br />true
<br />
<br />jazzisparis&#92;jip_glob.xml::@globals.xml::Strings
<br />true[/color]
<br />
<br />(Note: When required, you can include multiple entries in the same file, [u]as long as the line structure is kept[/u])[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=2]4. When done, save the file.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=2]You can then include this file in your release (make sure it retains the same folder path as in step 1).
<br />[line]

Delay DLC Combined 0.0.0-
====================================================
By Gribbleshnibit8 for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[size=4][color=#4FBBC5]DESCRIPTION:[/color][/size]
<br />This does exactly what it says in the title. It delays the DLC from starting immediately.
<br />
<br />It stops the annoying messages that display when a new DLC is loaded, and requires that you be within a certain distance of the broadcast location before you can pick up the radio signal. Once you do have the signal, you have to listen to the WHOLE thing in order to get the quest and map marker for the location. This was done because I like it that way.
<br />
<br />So, enjoy not being bombarded with "DLC Loaded" and "Level cap increased" messages in your new games.
<br />[line]

<br />[size=4][color=#4FBBC5]DETAILS:[/color][/size]
<br />
<br />[color=#F3A45F][b]Fallout New Vegas[/b][/color]
<br />[list][*][color=#6EBEC6]Dead Money:[/color] Limits the radio transmission range to about the middle of the Novac bridge. Introduces the requirement that you listen to the ENTIRE broadcast before you get the quest or the location.
<br />[*][color=#6EBEC6]Honest Hearts:[/color] Limits the radio transmission range to a radius that extends to the Durable Dunn caravan wreckage. Introduces the requirement that you listen to the ENTIRE broadcast before you get the quest or the location.
<br />[*][color=#6EBEC6]Old World Blues:[/color] Limits the radio transmission range to just to the south of Nipton if the player is below level 12, and just to the western side of Nipton Road Pit Stop if the player is over level 12.
<br />[*][color=#6EBEC6]Lonesome Road:[/color] Prevents the quest from appearing until you get very close. You must be in the playground above and to the west of the Primm NCR camp in order to get the quest, as well as be over level 25 (the suggested level).
<br />[*][color=#6EBEC6]Gun Runners' Arsenal:[/color] Stops the messages from letting you know you have GRA installed.

JIP LN NVSE Plugin 55.84.0
====================================================
By jazzisparis and LuthienAnarion for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[b][size=3]This mod is an extension to the New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE). It adds 900+ new functions, which can be used in GECK scripting and (in some cases) as conditions.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]As of v40.00, this plugin also includes all the functions from the (now defunct) Lutana NVSE Plugin, made by the venerable LuthienAnarion.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]For a full list and documentation of the new functions, please visit either [/size][url=https://geckwiki.com/index.php?title=Category:Functions_(JIP)]this page[/url][size=3], or [/size][url=https://geckwiki.com/index.php?title=Category:Functions_(Lutana)]this page[/url][size=3].[/size]
<br />
<br />[color=#00ff00][size=3]Additionally, this mod includes numerous engine bug fixes/tweaks, and restores several broken game features.[/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[color=#00ff00][size=3]Optional game patches (toggle-able via ..&#92;Data&#92;NVSE&#92;Plugins&#92;jip_nvse.ini):[/size][/color]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][size=3][color=#f9cb9c]bIgnoreDTDRFix[/color] - [/size][size=2]Fixes the Ignore DT/DR effect (mostly found in some melee/unarmed weapons), which is completely broken in the game. In addition, modifies the game's damage-reduction calculation, such that DT is subtracted BEFORE DR is applied.[/size][/b]
<br />[/list][/b][b]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][size=3][color=#f9cb9c]bEnableFO3Repair[/color] - [/size][size=2]Brings back the FO3-style item repair menu to FNV. The max repair amount of items will be capped to the player's Repair skill. For example, with 75 skill, items can only be repaired for up to 75% of their max health, as opposed to 100% as before, regardless of skill level.[/size][/b]
<br />[/list][/b][b]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][size=3][color=#f9cb9c]bEnableBigGunsSkill[/color] - [/size][size=2]Restores Big Guns as a fully-functional, playable skill.[/size][/b]
<br />[/list][/b][b]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][size=3][color=#f9cb9c]bProjImpactDmgFix[/color] - [/size][size=2]Fixes an engine bug where weapons which fire projectiles that explode upon impact (i.e. Missile Launcher, Grenade Launcher, etc.) would only apply the damage from the explosion, even on direct hit, ignoring the weapon's hit damage.[/size][/b]
<br />[/list][/b][b]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][size=3][color=#f9cb9c]bGameDaysPassedFix[/color] - [/size][size=2]Fixes an engine bug where the 'GameDaysPassed' and 'GameHour' global timers would "freeze" and stop increasing in game real-time (they would only increase when sleeping, waiting or fast traveling). This issue directly affected hardcore needs build-up, which would also freeze in game real-time.[/size][/b]
<br />[/list][/b][b]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][size=3][color=#f9cb9c]bHardcoreNeedsFix[/color] - [/size][size=2]Fixes an issue where some hardcore needs could, for undetermined reasons, end up having negative values. This resulted in hardcore needs not increasing at the correct rate/ at all.[/size][/b]
<br />[/list][/b][b]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bNoFailedScriptLocks[/size][/color][size=2] - Fixes an engine behavior where a script that has failed (due to any reason) at some point during execution will be effectively disabled by the game and will no longer be processed again until the game is restarted.[/size][/b]
<br />[/list]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bDoublePrecision[/size][/color] - Modifies the game's code such that arithmetic/relational operations in scripts are calculated/evaluated with double-precision floating-point accuracy (instead of single-precision). This was causing various issues, where relational operators (==, !=, &lt;=, &lt;, &gt;=, &gt;) were not evaluating correctly, and numeric calculations ended with inaccurate results (this was especially observed with relatively high absolute values). Additionally, this patch also guarantees no script errors/crashes in cases of division by zero.[/b]
<br />[/list]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bQttSelectShortKeys[/size][/color] - If enabled, (a) when selecting an item stack in either the inventory, container, or barter menus, holding SHIFT will transfer/drop the entire stack, whilst holding CTRL will transfer/drop a single item from the stack - thus skipping the quantity-select menu. (b) Picking up from a container a stack of items that are weightless (such as ammo on non-hardcore mode) will bring up the quantity-select menu, instead of automatically picking the entire stack.[/b]
<br />[/list]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bMultiProjectileFix[/size][/color] - Fixes an engine bug where using weapons which fire multiple projectiles per shot could often cause brief lags and FPS drops when hitting live targets.[/b]
<br />[/list]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bLocalizedDTDR[/size][/color] - When enabled, a distinction will be made between head-armor and body-armor when applying damage reduction from DR/DT. Head hits will benefit only from DT/DR gained from worn head-armor (if any), whereas body hits, in similar fashion, only from DT/DR gained from worn body-armor. (Note: Requires bIgnoreDTDRFix to be enabled).[/b]
<br />[/list]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bVoiceModulationFix[/size][/color] - Adds voice modulation (a slight distortion effect) for talking activators and holotapes.[/b]
<br />[/list]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bSneakBoundingBoxFix[/size][/color] - Fixes a longstanding Bethesda games' bug where the dimensions of the collision bounding box encapsulating the player (as well as all NPCs) remained fixed and did not scale to correspond to body posture. This, effectively, had made it impossible to crawl through breaches and spaces when crouched, despite being able to easily fit through them. This patch fixes this issue for the player character and human companions.[/b]
<br />[/list]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bEnableNVACAlerts[/size][/color] - If NVAC is installed, enable this setting to receive in-game alerts in the event an exception has occurred in the game's code that was successfully handled by NVAC. You will be notified by a corner message, and the error's details will be printed to the console. This should make it a lot easier to identify the precise circumstances/location in which the error has occurred.[/b]
<br />[/list]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bLoadScreenFix[/size][/color] - Forces the load menu to give priority to location-specific load screens (if any are found to match current location) when selecting a load screen to display.[/b]
<br />[/list]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bNPCWeaponMods[/size][/color] - When enabled, all NPCs will have a chance for their main weapon to include weapon mods. The chance is based on each NPC's level - the higher the level, the greater the chance. The type of mod(s) is selected randomly from the ones available for the particular weapon. Weapons have a chance to include multiple mods, though 2 mods is rare, and a fully-modded weapon is uncommon.[/b]
<br />[/list]
<br />[color=#00ff00]Game fixes/tweaks (applied by default):[/color]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b][size=2]Using the console does not block earning new Steam achievements.[/size][/b]
<br />[*][b][size=2]The console is fully functional even when a controller is plugged.[/size][/b]
<br />[*][b][size=2]Disabling controller vibration, either via the Settings Menu, or by setting bGamePadRumble=0 in FalloutPrefs.ini, does what it was supposed to do - completely disable any motor vibrations (this should significantly prolong the life of your batteries).[/size][/b]
<br />[*][b][size=2]Custom made armor audio templates work properly and are no longer ignored by the game.[/size][/b]
<br />[*][b][size=2]Calling [i]RemoveMe[/i] from within a [i]OnAdd[/i] block will not cause a CTD when moving a stack of items to the player's inventory from the container/barter menus.[/size][/b]
<br />[*][b][size=2]The maximum character-count of corner messages is increased from 259 to 515.[/size][/b]
<br />[*][b][size=2]The character-count limit of perk descriptions, displayed in the trait menu, is increased from 512 to 1024.[/size][/b]
<br />[*][b][size=2]Vendor names are displayed correctly when first opening the barter menu.[/size][/b]
<br />[*][b][size=2]The hard-coded grass fade-distance limit of 3,000 is removed.[/size][/b]
<br />[*][b]Adding a perk for teammates ([i]player.AddPerk PerkID 1[/i]) does not erroneously apply the effects of every entry point multiple times, equal to the current number of teammates.[/b]
<br />[*][b]The effects of teammate perks are properly applied on teammates upon game load. [/b]
<br />[*][b]Medicine/Survival skill bonuses will no longer boost the magnitudes of detrimental effects of medicine/food items.[/b]
<br />[*][b]The mouse scroll wheel can be used in the quantity prompt menu for (dec-)increasing selected quantity.[/b]
<br />[*][b]Ammo effects are shown in the crafting menus; correct item value and weight displayed.[/b]
<br />[*][b][i]Constant[/i]-type global variables retain their values upon exiting to the main menu.[/b]
<br />[*][b]Gun shell-casings' lifetime in 1st person uses the [i]fGunShellLifetime[/i] GMST (as in 3rd person), instead of being capped at 2 seconds.[/b]
<br />[*][b]Moving weapons, which have mods attached, to/from a container (or barter buy/sell) does not make them lose the "+" suffix to their names.[/b]
<br />[*][b]Fixes a serious issue in the script parser, silently failing (buffer overflow) if any single script line had a compiled size greater than 72 bytes - a limit that could easily be reached when calling functions which take string arguments.[/b]

====================================================
Integration - Couriers Stash - Vanilla 1.3.0
====================================================
By The-Silenced for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

Integration - Courier\'s Stash
THIS MOD REQUIRES [url=http://nvse.silverlock.org]NVSE[/url]
and at least one of the pre-order packs.
========================================
[u]Description[/u]
========================================
This mod changes how the Pre-Order packs Weapons & Armor are handled.

No more free equipment just after waking up in Good Springs.

Now the Weapons and Armor are added to the leveled lists as alternates of their generic equivalents.

Anywhere you could normally find say...a 10MM Pistol, you will now have a chance to find a 10MM Pistol, Reinforced or with Leather Armor you could now find a Leather Armor, Lightweight instead.

========================================
[u]Details[/u]
========================================
The equipments new names:

Weapons:
Weathered 10MM Pistol		-->	10MM Pistol, Reinforced
Mercenary Grenade Rifle		-->	Grenade Rifle, Lightweight
Broad Machete			-->	Machete, Broad
Sturdy Caravan Shotgun		-->	Caravan Shotgun, Sturdy
Armor:
Lightweight Leather Armor	-->	Leather Armor, Lightweight
Armored Vault 13 Jumpsuit	-->	Vault 13 Jumpsuit, Armored
Lightweight Metal Armor		-->	Metal Armor, Lightweight
Tribal Raiding Armor		-->	Not included (Reason listed below)

And the Perks they will now work with:

10MM Pistol, Reinforced:     \"The Professional\" and is now considered an \"Improved Holdout Weapon\".
Grenade Rifle, Lightweight:  \"Demolition Expert\", \"Grunt\" and will also ignite gas traps on hit now.
Machete, Broad:                 Can now have poison applied and is added to the appropriate GRA challenges.
Caravan Shotgun, Sturdy:      \"Shotgun Surgeon\"
Metal Armor, Lightweight:     \"In Shining Armor\" and will no longer receive the benefits from \"Travel Light\" and \"Light Touch\" perks.

All equipment has been added to there vanilla equivalents repair lists.

The vault armor and canteen have not been added to the leveled lists but to the vault 21 gift shop store.

The tribal raiding armor however I didn\'t include because it uses the same mesh and texture as the raider blast master armor so I didn\'t see the point in including it.

Also the caravan shotgun has a script to fix the VATS critical bug that all shotguns have.

========================================
[u]Install[/u]
========================================

ONLY INSTALL ONE OF THESE PLUGINS!!!

I would greatly suggest you use a mod manager like [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/36901]FOMM[/url] or  [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35003]Wrye Flash[/url]
There is also the Nexus Mod Manger, but I\'ve never used that one.

1. This mod Requires [url=http://nvse.silverlock.org/]NVSE[/url] to be installed.  It will not work without it.

2. If you have all 4 Pre-order packs install one of the \"Integration - Courier\'s Stash\" variants which deals with all 4 packs.
If you don\'t have all the packs then install the individual Integration Packages.

3. If you are using [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35681]Shotgun Commando[/url] then use one of the Shotgun Commando variants (Caravan pack and Couriers stash only).

4. If you use [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/39651]WMX[/url] then use one of the WMX variants IN PLACE OF the WMX pre-order plugin(s).

========================================
[u]Uninstall[/u]
========================================

To uninstall Integration - Courier\'s Stash, simply deactivate the mod package in the mod manager of your choice.

or

To uninstall manually just delete the .esp and (if applicable) the BSA.

If you don\'t have a clue how to install a mod manually then read [url=http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1533535]this little post[/url] as a starting point.

========================================
[u]Load Order[/u]
========================================
Load after anything that changes the Pre-Order pack weapons & armor.

This applies to all Versions.

All leveled list and form list changes are done through script so no need to worry about those.
========================================
[u]Compatibility[/u]
========================================
Not compatible with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/39123]Classic Pack 10mm bug fix[/url] by Chucksteel as it is merged into the mod.

[s]Minor incompatibility with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/46138]	
Gun Runners Arsenal GRA - The Right to Bear Arms[/url] in that it causes 3 leather armors (1 normal & 2 Light) to spawn on any NPC that would normally get 1.[/s] No longer an issue as of 1.2

Compatible with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35681]Shotgun Commando[/url] with one of the Shotgun Commando versions.
Compatible with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/39651]WMX[/url] with one of the WMX versions.
Compatible with Jsawyer mod so long this is loaded after it.
Compatible with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/37576]WME[/url] because as far as I know it doesn\'t have any pre-order plugins.

========================================
[u]Known Issues[/u]
========================================
The Classic pack\'s pistol will not change it\'s model when modded.  This is an issue with the Classic Pack it\'s self not this mod.  To bypass this issue this mod makes a new pistol object that mimics the original.  This mimic is the pistol that has been put in the leveled and form lists.  If you already had the original pistol in your inventory from before installing this mod it will not disappear however it also doesn\'t get the perk bonuses.

========================================
[u]Tools Used[/u]
========================================
G.E.C.K. (Obviously)
[url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34703]FNVEdit[/url] (Extremely useful tool.)
[url=http://notepad-plus-plus.org]Notepad ++[/url] (I wrote the scripts in this.)

========================================
[u]Permission and Credits[/u]
========================================
Use the \"Permissions and Credits\" button just below the \"Unique Downloads\" tracker at the top of the page.

MCM BugFix 2 0.0.0-
====================================================
By Pelinor for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

The Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) is a resource for other mods to use which adds a \"Mod Configuration\" button to the Pause menu.
When you click on it, a window appears with a list of all of the mods using MCM. Each of these listed mods are then configured from within the same menu.

As can be seen in the screenshots, a very user-friendly menu allows you to quickly and confidently configure your mods. You won\'t have to use any items or press any special keys to use it.

For modders wanting to use MCM menus for their mods, a detailed guide is given explaining how.

Mods using MCM only require MCM to be installed and activated to use the menu; there is no master dependency to the system, so your mod will still work if the user doesn\'t have MCM installed.

(Note: The Mod Configuration Menu is not to be redistributed with mods using it. Please provide a link to this page for users to acquire it.)

3. Select \"Package Manager\"

[size=5][color=#ffffdd][u]F.A.Q.[/u][/color][/size][list][*]Q. How do I use MCM?
[*]A. Pause the game and select \"Mod Configuration\" to configure your mods. You must also have MCM-compatible mods installed.

[*]Q. MCM tells me to remove redundant XML lines. How do I do this?
[*]A. You need to remove any duplicate <include src=\"MCM\\MCM.xml\"/> lines. There can be only one in Data\\menus\\options\\start_menu.xml or Data\\menus\\prefabs\\includes_StartMenu.xml

[*]Q. Will MCM be made for Fallout 3?
[*]A. Probably not. FOSE doesn\'t have the capabilities of NVSE that make MCM easily possible.

[*]Q. Why do none of my other MCM mods show up, even though I have Project Nevada installed with integrated MCM?
[*]A. You need to use the stand-alone MCM. The integrated Project Nevada version only works for that mod.

[*]Q. What do I do when my menu look weird after I updated Project Nevada to version 2.3?
[*]A. Update your MCM to the official version 1.2 or higher.

[*]Q. What do I do when I can\'t select mods that are at the bottom of the mod list?
[*]A. Install the MCM BugFix 1 file. Overwrite the existing plugin with the contents of that file.

<br />Adds a "Mod Configuration" menu with functions to load every weapon or armor currently loaded by the game and show advanced information about them.
<br />For weapons, you can show all ammo used by a weapon (and their effects), its DPS, sort the list by their fully-modded DPS, and more.  
<br />For apparel, you can show Damage Threshold, Damage Resistance, whether or not it's a disguise (and what faction it is for). You can sort them all by their damage threshold, damage resistance, or any skill buff/penalty from Sneak to Critical Chance.
<br />If cheat mode is enabled, a button will appear allowing you to add any apparel or weapon into your inventory. If it is a weapon, you will also receive every available mod for it and 10 clips worth of every ammo it uses.

JIP Companions Command &amp; Control 2.60.0
====================================================
By jazzisparis for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[b][color=#f1c232][size=4]Abstract[/size][/color]<br /><br />[size=3]This mod is designed to revolutionize the way companions are controlled and interacted with, bringing new elements of team-work and tactics, with the intention of making the game look and feel more like a proper role-playing game than an action-shooter.<br /><br />Using a HUD interface, companions can now be given any companion-wheel command (as well as a handful of new commands), all remotely, in real-time, without having to approach them and initiate dialogue. Effectively, this renders the companion-wheel obsolete.<br /><br />Similar to classic role-playing games, each companion will have its own avatar displayed on the HUD (see images section), with a health bar, and an indication of its current action (following/guarding/relaxing/in combat etc.).<br /><br />ANY companion, both vanilla and non-vanilla, should be fully-supported by this mod. Companions who have a working companion wheel, or are based on either the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/38059]NosCo[/url] or [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/38033]EZ[/url] companion systems, will be automatically added/removed as controlled companions when joining/leaving the party.<br /><br />This mod also includes a powerful tool which enables you to force-recruit and control ANY NPC/creature in the game (including enemies). This will be explained in more detail below.[/size]<br />[line]<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4]Key Features[/size][/color]<br /><br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=3]ALL vanilla companion-wheel commands. These include:[/size][/color]<br /><br />[list][*][size=2][b][color=#00ff00]Wait Here/Follow Me[/color][/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][size=2][b][color=#00ff00]Stay Close/Keep Distance[/color][/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][size=2][b][color=#00ff00]Use Melee/Ranged Weapon[/color][/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][size=2][b][color=#00ff00]Be Passive/Aggressive[/color][/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][size=2][b][color=#00ff00]Share Items (open companion&#39;s inventory)[/color][/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][size=2][b][color=#00ff00]Use a Stimpak (replaced by &#39;Use Aid Item(s)&#39;; see below)[/color][/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][b][color=#00ff00][size=2]Start Conversation[/size][/color][/b]<br />[/*][/list]<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=3]New, very useful commands:[/size][/color]<br /><br />[list][*][b][size=2][color=#00ff00]Attack Target[/color] - The companion will concentrate on attacking a single target (chosen by the player), using either a melee or a ranged weapon, and staying hidden if the player is in sneak mode.[/size][/b]<br />[/*][/list]<br />[list][*][b][size=2][color=#00ff00]Hack Terminal/Pick Lock/Disarm Trap or Mine[/color] - The companion will perform any of these actions on a target (selected by the player). Success chance is determined by a skill-check (based on the required skill and the companion&#39;s level) vs. task difficulty-level. Note that a companion is not required to be proficient in the relevant skill in order to make an attempt, but his success chance will be considerably lower.[/size][/b]<br />[/*][/list]<br />[list][*][b][size=2][color=#00ff00]Heal/Repair[/color] - The companion will treat the injuries of a living target, or repair a robotic target. The treatment includes restoring health, limb condition, curing poison and bringing round knocked-down companions - each requires the companion to carry the appropriate chems/parts in his inventory. For living targets, Stimpaks, Super-Stimpaks, Doctor&#39;s Bags, Antivenoms (and RadAways on the player&#39;s character) can be used; For robots, the following misc items can be used, for restoring both health and limbs: Wonderglue, duct tape, conductor, scrap metal and scrap electronics (each item restores a different amount, with Wonderglue being the least and scrap electronics being the most effective). The companion&#39;s skill and level are used when calculating the effectiveness of the treatment (i.e. how much health/limb condition is restored). Medicine skill is used when healing living targets, otherwise Repair skill is used. Note that when no target is selected, the companion will attempt to treat the player&#39;s character, instead.[/size][/b]<br />[/*][/list]<br />[list][*][b][size=2][color=#00ff00]Loot/Pickpocket[/color] - The companion will either loot an item (of any type) or a container, or pickpocket a target NPC (in both cases, selected by the player). As with Hack/Pick/Disarm, success chance is based on the companion&#39;s skill (Sneak), and is also modulated by several other parameters (such as the environment and alertness of nearby NPCs). Looted items will be found in the companion&#39;s inventory. Aside from the obvious advantage of being able to utilize yet another companion skill, another advantage is that no karma/reputation loss is suffered when stealing/pickpocketing, provided the companion was able to complete the task without being detected. If caught, however, the usual negative effects will apply (though any stolen goods will not be confiscated).[/size][/b]<br />[/*][/list]<br />[list][*][b][size=2][color=#00ff00]Use Crafting Station[/color] - The companion will use a workbench, a reloading bench, or a campfire to craft items. This will open the appropriate recipe menu, depending on which crafting station was targeted. The companion&#39;s skills will be used (instead of the player&#39;s) to determine which items can be crafted. The companion will also receive a temporary skill boost, equal to his level. All the ingredients required for crafting the items must be carried by the companion, in his inventory.[/size][/b]<br />[/*][/list]<br />[list][*][b][size=2][color=#00ff00]Move To and Stand Guard[/color] - The companion will move to where the crosshair is pointed at and remain there on guard, attacking any enemy who comes near, and staying hidden if the player is in sneak mode.[/size][/b]<br />[/*][/list]<br />[list][*][b][size=2][color=#00ff00]Use Aid Item(s)[/color] - An improved, more &#34;intelligent&#34; version of the companion wheel&#39;s &#39;Use Stimpak&#39; option. Stimpaks, Super-Stimpacks, Doctor&#39;s Bags or Antivenoms - any of these can be used by a companion when given this command. Only those items which are required to treat his current injuries (if any) will be used, to prevent waste. If the companion is within 10 feet of the player, the player&#39;s Medicine skill will be used to determine the effectiveness of the healing item (unless the companion has a higher skill). If the companion is farther than 10 feet, he will need to carry the required items in his inventory. Note that non-human companions cannot heal themselves, and must therefore be very close to the player when using this option.[/size][/b]<br />[/*][/list]<br />[list][*][b][size=2][color=#00ff00]Relax[/color] - The companion will go into &#34;sandbox&#34; mode, interacting with idle markers, furniture, food, drink and other NPCs in his vicinity.[/size][/b]<br />[/*][/list]<br />[list][*][b][size=2][color=#00ff00]Cancel Command[/color] - Cease doing any of the above.[/size][/b]<br />[/*][/list]<br /><br />[size=3][color=#9fc5e8]Force-recruit NPC/creature[/color] - This powerful tool enables you to force NPCs/creatures into joining your party and become fully-functional companions. &#34;Forced&#34; companions will follow any command given to them via the CC&C command interface. Creatures will also have a portrait in the companion bar.[/size]<br />[list][*][size=2][b]ANY NPC/creature in the game can be force-recruited (including enemies).[/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][size=2][b]Force-recruiting an NPC/creature will override its normal AI behaviour/routine. Use with caution when force-hiring plot-related NPCs.[/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][b][size=2]This can be used with &#34;simple&#34;, custom companions created in the GECK and added to the game - you don&#39;t have to make or deal with any scripts/packages/dialogue at all.[/size][/b]<br />[/*][/list][color=#00ff00][size=3]How to use:[/size][/color]<br />[list=1][*][size=2][b]Hold down the Force-Recruit hotkey (the key is set from the MCM control-panel).[/b][/size]<br />[/*]<br />[*][size=2][b]Point the crosshair at the target NPC/creature until it flashes green.[/b][/size]<br />[/*]<br />[*][size=2][b]Release the key and confirm.[/b][/size]<br />[/*]<br />[*][b][size=2]To dismiss a forced-recruited companion, open the Companion Settings Panel (see below) and select &#39;Dismiss Companion&#39;.[/size][/b]<br />[/*]<br />[/list]<br /><br />[size=3][color=#9fc5e8]Manage Equipment[/color] - Enables complete control over the equipment companions use. Have a companion (un-)equip a weapon/armor, or use a consumable item (chem/food/magazine), similarly to how it is done with the player character - via the inventory menu. The companion&#39;s equipment is &#34;locked&#34;, preventing him from switching equipped items independently.[/size]<br />[color=#00ff00][size=3]How to use:[/size][/color]<br />[list=1]<br />[*][b]Open the companion&#39;s inventory (use the &#39;Open Inventory&#39; command).[/b]<br /><br />[*][b]Highlight an item, then right-click (or press the &#39;X&#39; button - if using a controller).[/b]<br /><br />[/list]<br /><br />[size=3][color=#9fc5e8]True Passive Mode[/color] - With this option enabled, a companion that is set to &#39;Be Passive&#39; will become truly passive in combat - he will draw his weapon and remain close to the player (or stay put if told to wait), but will not engage enemies at all. There are five optional settings:[/size]<br />[list][*][size=2][b]OFF (vanilla behaviour).[/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][size=2][b]Remain passive until taking damage.[/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][size=2][b]Remain passive until the player attacks an enemy.[/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][size=2][b]Remain passive until either taking damage or the player attacks.[/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][b][size=2]Remain passive always.[/size][/b]<br />[/*][/list]<br /><br />[size=3][color=#9fc5e8]Infinite Companion Ammo[/color] - With this setting enabled, companions will no longer consume ammo when not using their default weapons. Note that a companion must still carry at least one round of the required ammo type in order to equip a weapon.[/size]<br /><br /><br />[size=3][color=#9fc5e8]Unlimited Companions[/color] - With this enabled, you will be able to recruit as many companions as you like, and will no longer be restricted to having a maximum of two companions (one humanoid, one critter) at a time. This option can be switched on/off from in-game, at any time.[/size]<br /><br /><br />[size=3][color=#9fc5e8]Draw with the Player[/color] - Toggling this option will make companions draw/holster their weapons when the player does.[/size]<br /><br /><br />[size=3][color=#9fc5e8]No Recovery on Combat End[/color] - With this setting enabled, companions will no longer fully-recover health and limb injuries when combat ends. When regaining consciousness, companions will recover only 15% of their total health.[/size]<br /><br /><br />[size=3][color=#9fc5e8]Companion Settings Panel[/color] - Various settings can be configured from this panel for each companion, individually:[/size]<br />[list][*][size=2][b][color=#00ff00]Essential[/color] - Prevents the companion from dying when reaching 0 health. Only applicable in hardcore mode.[/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][size=2][b][color=#00ff00]Infinite Ammo[/color] - Whether the &#39;Infinite Companion Ammo&#39; option will apply on the companion.[color=#ff0000]*[/color][/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][size=2][b][color=#00ff00]Manage Equipment[/color] - Whether the option of the same name will apply on the companion.[color=#ff0000]*[/color][/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][size=2][b][color=#00ff00]Set Home Marker[/color] - Marks a specific location as the companion&#39;s &#34;home&#34;.[/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][size=2][b][color=#00ff00]Go to Home Marker[/color] - Self-explanatory.[/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][size=2][b][color=#00ff00]View Stats[/color] - Displays the companion&#39;s statistics and attributes, including current location, experience level, SPECIAL, skill level, damage threshold, damage resistance, encumbrance rate and limb condition.[/b][/size]<br />[/*][*][b][size=2][color=#00ff00]Remove from Companions Bar[/color] - Self-explanatory.

JIP Fast-Travel Anywhere 0.60.0
====================================================
By jazzisparis for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[b][color=#f1c232][size=4]Abstract[/size][/color]<br /><br />[size=3]This mod enables fast-traveling to ANY point on the world-map - you will no longer be limited to marked, discovered locations. Pressing a hotkey will display the current world-map on your HUD, where you can select your destination. The restrictions on fast-traveling will apply here, as well: The journey will consume time; You will not be able to fast travel while over-encumbered, during combat, from indoors, and so forth.<br />Moreover, your journey may be interrupted somewhere en route by a random encounter with enemies.[/size]<br />[line]<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4]Using [i]Fast-Travel Anywhere[/i][/size][/color]<br /><br />[list][*][b][size=2]Press the Map Hotkey (&#39;M&#39; by default) to show/hide the map.

Note that this feature is only available for the NV/DC wasteland maps (DLC maps are small enough to not require it).[/size][/b]<br />[/*]<br />[*][b][size=2]Move the cursor over the map to your desired destination, then left-click/press ENTER to confirm, and you will fast-travel there.[/size][/b][/*]<br />[/list]<br /><br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=3]Random Encounters[/size][/color]<br />[size=2]When fast-travelling using FTA, there is a chance that, somewhere along the road, your party will be ambushed by enemies.[/size]<br />[list][*][b][size=2]The location of the ambush, the type of enemies and their number, are completely random.[/size][/b]<br />[/*]<br />[*][b][size=2]The farther the destination, the more likely you are to encounter enemies.[/size][/b]<br />[/*]<br />[*][b][size=2]The level of enemies encountered is proportional to your own level.[/size][/b]<br />[/*]<br />[*][b][size=2]Random encounters can occur only in the New Vegas or Capital wastelands.[/size][/b]<br />[/*]<br />[/list]<br />[size=3]Encounter settings (accessible via the MCM control-panel)[/size]<br />[size=2][u]Encounter Chance[/u]:[/size]<br />[list][*][b][size=2]Calculated for every 1 mile of travel distance.

You are also informed of the distance to the destination (you&#39;ll be amazed how small the map really is), as well as the time it would take to travel there.[/size][/b]<br />[/*]<br />[*][b][size=2]The mod currently supports the Mojave Wasteland, Zion Canyon, Big MT, Capital Wasteland, The Pitt and Point Lookout maps only (the later three require TTW). Dead Money and Lonesome Road are not supported, since both are linear and not really open worlds, so please do not request those.[/size][/b]<br />[/*]<br />[*][b][size=2]Fast-Travel Anywhere means, literally, ANYWHERE. This includes locations on the map you are not supposed to be able to reach, outside the playable map, where there is nothing but blank terrain. It is safe (albeit completely pointless) to travel there, if you are feeling curious.[/size][/b]<br />[/*]<br />[*][b][size=2]There is one exception to the above: You will not be able to use FTA to travel to/from pocket-worldspaces (i.e. worldspaces that have a parent worldspace, and do not have their own world-map). For instance, you cannot use FTA from the New Vegas Strip to travel to other locations on the map. Similarly, you cannot use FTA to travel to the Strip - you will end up in a patch of empty landscape, surrounded by dummy buildings.

FOOK v1-13 Required Files 1.13.0
====================================================
By The FOOK Team for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

Name: FOOK - New Vegas<br />Version: 1.13<br />Date: 16/03/2014<br />Category: Gameplay Effects and Changes<br />Requirements: Fallout: New Vegas 1.4.0.525, Fallout Mod Manager, Fallout: New Vegas DLCs (optional), NVSE v2b12 (optional), The Mod Configuration Menu 1.2 (optional)<br />Author(s): The FOOK Team<br />Source: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34684<br /><br />===============<br />Description:<br />===============<br /><br />FOOK - New Vegas is an overhaul for the Fallout: New Vegas game. FOOK is a coherent and balanced overhaul, adding and fully integrating many bug fixes, new items, high quality retextures and gameplay features to the base game. It also has full support for the Fallout: New Vegas DLCs.<br /><br />===============<br />Latest features:<br />===============<br /><br />So yeah, two years after the last update, here&#39;s a new one&#33; Hope you will enjoy it. Thanks to Jonnyeah, Drithius and blove for their help and support.<br /><br />You can find gameplay spoilers about FOOK in the FOOK_FullNotes.txt file, including where you can find the unique weapons and armors of the mod.<br /><br />Remember - don&#39;t use the &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs&#34; ESM file if you don&#39;t own Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, Lonesome Road AND the Gun Runners&#39; Arsenal. The Courier&#39;s Stash is not required.<br /><br />1.13 Changes<br />------------<br /><br />Dead Money<br />* Fixed Ghost people having a Perception of 0, the value will be 1 now.<br />* Fixed the Holorifle&#39;s maximal health being set to 101.5% instead of 150% by the Holorifle reinforced components mod.<br /><br />Lonesome Road<br />* Red Victory Grenade Rifle is not considered a Grunt perk weapon anymore, but is now considered a Communist perk weapon.<br /><br />Gun Runners&#39; Arsenal<br />* Fixed Sleepytyme missing from the Improved Holdout weapons list.<br /><br />Armors<br />* Fixed all variants of the Radiation Suit and Hazmat Suit having disembodied hands in 1st person view.<br />* Fixed several Metal Armor variants not having correct normal maps.<br /><br />Leveled Items<br />* Fixed the .45 ACP and Railway Spikes ammo lists. They were spawning with either the full amount of ammunitions or nothing.<br /><br />Recipes<br />* Fixed the BBs crafting recipes to be less exploitable.<br /><br />Weapons<br />* Updated the textures of the following weapons: Marksman Carbine, Makarov PM, .44 Magnum Revolver, Taurus Raging Bull, Grenade Launcher, Grenade Rifle, Combat Shotgun, 9mm Submachine Gun, Gauss Rifle, VSS Vintorez and their uniques counterparts.<br />* New mods added to the Makarov PM, the Taurus Raging Bull and the FN FAL.<br />* Fixed lack of 3D sounds for all variants of the Power Fist.<br />* Fixed the Cryolator to spawn more spaced gibs to avoid clipping.<br />* Slight nerf of the Fiend Roaster.<br />* Added a cut icon for the Golden Gloves.<br /><br />===============<br />Details:<br />===============<br /><br />FOOK Menus<br />* To open them, equip the [FOOK Menu Hotkey] in your inventory or, if you have NVSE, just press O (not zero, O, the letter&#33; Press it for at least a second).<br />* There is an option to activate (in Doc Mitchell&#39;s house) the FOOK QA Boxes containing all of the game&#39;s items. You can also just open them on the fly using the right options. If you have NVSE, just press = (for at least a second) to open the proper menu.<br />* If you have NVSE, you can edit the game to give yourself a perk at each level, allow or disallow Repair in Combat, and much more&#33;<br />* You can also remove your Pipboy glove, give yourself the Power Armor Training perk, access an infinite Bag of Holding, and more&#33;<br />* FOOK also support the &#34;Mod Configuration Menu&#34;, and all of the FOOK Menus have been mirrored in MCM for your convenience.<br /><br />FOOK Global Features<br />* Bug fixing: FOOK brings to New Vegas thousands of little fixes that can&#39;t be described because they would be too numerous - for example, NPCs having the wrong class, weapons not counting for their respective perks, etc.<br />* Improved Character Generation: You can now play a Raider or an Old character. Many new presets from Fo3 NPCs included, such as Colonel Autumn or Dad. Finally, added an unused female haircut (Cherry Taste) and fixed disappearing eyebrows.<br />* Improved crafting: FOOK brings back the interesting weapon crafting part of Fallout 3 with both new and old weapons. The hunt for schematics will test your wits and your sense of exploration&#33;<br />* Inventory Sorter: There is now several main Ingestible categories: AID (Stimpak), ALCH (Whiskey), CHEM (Buffout), DRNK (Nuka-Cola), FOOD, MAG (Lad&#39;s Life), and TOX (Bleak Venom). The Misc Items categories are BOOK (skill books), CURR (Pre-War Money, Legion Denarius), CARD (Casino cards), RELO (Lead), MOD (weapons mods), QST (quest items) and PART (crafting components). The Inventory Sorter only works with NVSE, needs to be enabled in the FOOK NVSE menu and doesn&#39;t work with Project Nevada - use their one, instead&#33;<br />* Graphic Overhaul: alcohols, creatures, new icons, weapons, many textures were improved to be more beautiful. It also includes some fixes, such as removing the visible &#39;101&#39; on the back of the Vault 34 Security Armor and the Sierra Madre Security Armors under certain light conditions.<br />* New places: Toxic Cave, a balanced low-level dungeon near Primm. The Nevada Brake & Auto, south of McCarran. The Radiation King Shop, in Freeside. The Smuggler Cache, a place south of Westside.<br />* Night Vision: Enhance your vision with some headgears like the Power Helmets. To use this feature, equip the [Nightvision Switch] in your inventory or, if you have NVSE, just press N (for at least a second). The NVGs need some time to be fully loaded, and you can edit the duration of their batteries in the FOOK menus.<br /><br />FOOK NVSE Features<br />* Shortcuts to many features like the FOOK Menus (just press O or = for at least a second, as said above) and Night Vision (N) on some helmets.<br />* Melee Lock-On: Allows you to lock on to enemies via a hotkey (C) while you have an Unarmed or Melee weapon equipped.<br /><br />Dead Money<br />* Sierra Madre Martini: Will now work like any alcohol, including dehydration.<br />* Gold Bars: can now be moved around with the &#34;grab&#34; command when dropped.<br />* Elijah&#39;s Last Words/Elijah&#39;s Ramblings: Now provide bonuses to the Unarmed skill rather than the Melee Weapons skill (Veronica didn&#39;t even had Melee Weapons tagged).<br />* Junk Rounds: Added .22LR and 12.7mm to the crafting list. Also, instead of crafting normal rounds, you&#39;ll now craft &#34;Junk&#34; (JNK) rounds, doing less damage and more dangerous to your weapons. On the bright side, you need much less material now, and you can still craft any kind of ammunition at 45 Repair.<br />* Holographic Vendors: Will now sell the recipe to craft Fixer at the Vending Machines.<br />* Automatic Rifle: Rebalanced similarly to how others automatic weapons were rebalanced in the official 1.3 patch (Spread halved, Health doubled, AP cost reduced). It can now also be rarely found in the Mojave Wasteland.<br />* Bear Trap Fist: Rebalanced to be slightly weaker than a Power Fist but to have better Crits and Limb Damages than it.<br />* Holorifle: Will now have visible changes to its mesh as weapon mod kits are added to it.<br />* Knife Spear Clean: Fixed to really have clean Cosmic Knives on its mesh.<br />* Police Pistol: Made a Tier 1 weapon and can now be rarely found in the Mojave Wasteland. Mesh slightly improved, iron sights fixed and ground model added.<br />* Throwing Knife Spear: Rebalanced similarly to how the Throwing Spear was rebalanced in a recent official patch. Can now be used by NPCs.<br /><br />Honest Hearts<br />* Playable Tribal races.<br />* 37 new unique loading tips, since Honest Hearts didn&#39;t had a single one before. The topics are Zion Canyon, Mormons, Tribals, the state of Utah, John Browning, the .45 ACP Round and the M1911 Pistol, and finally Vault 22 and its legacy.<br />* Spore Carrier Sap: Can now also be found on dead Spore Carriers from the vanilla game and Old World Blues.<br />* Grunt: Damage bonuses reduced from 25% to 20%. Doesn&#39;t affect the Marksman Carbine and the All-American anymore, but now affects This Machine and the M1 Garand. Extended to work with Bayonets and American assault rifles, like the R91 Assault Rifle.<br />* Fixed a bug where traveling to Zion in February would take 10 months rather than the usual two weeks (I&#39;m not kidding).<br />* A Light Shining in Darkness: Now a standard Holdout Weapon, as it was intended by the developers.<br />* .45 Auto Pistol: Fixed the glowing iron sights dots. Made a Tier 3 weapon, as it was intended by the developers.<br />* Compliance Regulator: Now with iron sights.<br />* Fire Bomb: Now much more powerful (as much as an Incendiary Grenade) but will explode on impact. Aim well&#33; Also, enemies dieing from a Fire Bomb critical hit wont be reduced to plasma goo anymore.<br /><br />Old World Blues<br />* Playable Lobotomite race.<br />* Added 37 new loading screens unique to Old World Blues.<br />* Fixes all weapons so they use their 1st Person Textures when used in 1st Person.<br />* Fixes numerous bugs about Old World Blues entries overriding vanilla New Vegas entries, such as empty Ammo Boxes suddenly containing Energy Weapons ammunition.<br />* Battle Brew: Now works like Vodka (no Intelligence loss with the Whiskey Rose perk, no dehydration with the Communist perk).<br />* Atomic-Valence Tri-Radii-Oscillator: Doesn&#39;t flatten hairs when worn anymore. Now uses the Earrings node.<br />* Lobotomite Goggles: Now has NVG capacity.<br />* Hazmat Suit: The suit now comes with integrated gloves, and can&#39;t be separated from its helmet. The Night Vision effect can also be turned ON/OFF with the standard FOOK NVG hotkey.<br />* Valence Radii-Accentuator: Doesn&#39;t flatten hairs when worn anymore. Now uses the Earrings node.<br />* Christine&#39;s COS Silencer Rifle: Can now be modded with Sniper Rifle Carbon Fiber Parts.<br />* FIDO: Can now be modded like its non-unique counterpart. Magazine now holds 100 bullets instead of 50.<br />* K9000 Cyberdog Gun: Magazine now holds 100 bullets instead of 50.<br /><br />Lonesome Road<br />* Added 40 new loading screens unique to Lonesome Road.<br />* Riot Gear Helmet: Can&#39;t stack with other headgears anymore. The Night Vision effect has been changed to use the FOOK NVG system. The helmet now has a visible neck cover.<br />* Advanced Riot Gear Helmet: Can&#39;t stack with other headgears anymore. The Night Vision effect has been changed to use the FOOK NVG system. The helmet now has a visible neck cover.<br />* Elite Riot Gear Helmet: Can&#39;t stack with other headgears anymore. The Night Vision effect has been changed to use the FOOK NVG system. The helmet now has a visible neck cover.<br />* The Marked Men are now affected by the Fight the Power&#33; perk.<br />* Broad Daylight: Is now a level 12 perk with an Agility and Sneak requirement - since the FOOK NVGs made it useless, it seems fair to make it a mid-level perk.<br />* Certified Tech: Now properly adds 25% to the current Critical Chance against Robots instead of adding 0.25%.<br />* Marked: The DT bonus won&#39;t show up in the Pipboy anymore, but it will still be present when shot. Tooltip was also fixed to mention DT instead of DR.<br />* Robotics Expert: Is now a level 26 perk with a Perception and Science requirement. It was mainly to be more accessible for Old World Blues and to be selectable even when limited by the Logan&#39;s Loophole trait.<br />* Laser Detonator: Not a quest item anymore. Be careful not to lose it&#33;<br /><br />Gun Runners&#39; Arsenal<br />* Some of the Arsenal&#39;s Unique weapons have changed location - you either have to buy them from other vendors (Esther, Medicine Stick, Li&#39;l Devil, Two-Step Goodbye) or you must find them through exploration (Embrace of the Mantis King&#33;, MF Hyperbreeder Alpha, Nuka-Breaker, Paciencia, Sleepytyme). Happy hunting&#33;<br />* Around 80 fixes and improvements to the Meshes & Textures of the Arsenal&#39;s weapons.<br />* Added the 25mm Grenade APW, the 5.56mm Pistol, the Battle Rifle and the Katana to the various leveled lists (enemies, loot, vendors) of the Mojave Wasteland.<br />* Replaced the GRA vanilla weapons copies with their vanilla counterparts. For example, you can now upgrade the vanilla Assault Carbine with the GRA mods, and it will count for the GRA Challenges. The vanilla Fat Man can also shoot the new GRA Mini Nukes.<br />* Replaced the GRA vanilla item mods copies with their vanilla counterparts. For example, instead of using the GRA-only &#34;Assault Carb. Ext. Mags&#34; item mod, you will use the vanilla &#34;Assault Carbine Extended Magazines&#34; item mod.<br />* Fixed the GRA ammunition and mods being unleveled - for example, you&#39;ll only start to find the new GRA Mini Nukes at higher level now, instead of always being present. The new item mods will also seamlessly be integrated into the vanilla mod lists.<br />* Removed the annoying &#34;GRA&#34; tags from every entries (ammunition, recipes, weapons) besides the Challenges.<br />* Removed the &#34;Vigilant Recycler&#34; tag from the new Optimized energy ammunition, since it is not necessary for their identification.<br />* Removed the &#34;Mad Bomber&#34; tag from the new crafted Explosives, since it is not necessary for their identification.<br />* New item mod: Hunting Revolver Sniper Scope.<br />* New item mod: Ripper High-Speed Motor.<br />* Fixed the 20 Gauge and 12 Gauge Pulse Slugs not properly affecting all power-armored NPCs.<br />* Nuka-Grenade (GRA): Now renamed &#34;Nuka Quartz-Grenade&#34; to mark the difference with the FOOK Nuka-Grenade.<br /><br />Activators<br />* Ash & Goo Piles: Now scripted to disappear properly after four days.<br />* Shotgun Trap: Will now always grant you a shotgun when deactivated.<br />* Many previously silent radios (such as in the Lucky 38 suite) have been edited to listen to Radio New Vegas when activated.<br /><br />Ammunition<br />* Energy Weapons ammunition Weight reduced, now uses the same values as the JSawyer mod.<br />* Real rounds were given their real names (.45 Auto is now .45 ACP, .50MG is now .50BMG).<br />* Harmonized the name of all the ammunition to have a better global coherence and to avoid word-wrapping (&#34;12.7mm Round, Hollow Point&#34; is now &#34;12.7mm (Hollow Point)&#34;, for example).<br />* Harmonized the capacity of all the same kind of ammunition - for example, all 5mm rounds now properly have a DT modifier, all buckshot shells have a proper damage modifier, etc.<br />* 10mm, JHP (Hand Load): Has been replaced by the 10mm JSP round, with improved damage and a minor armor-piercing capability.<br />* 12 Gauge Shotgun Shells: Magnum and Slug rounds now have a higher chance of recovering a hull whenever fired off.<br />* 20 Gauge Shotgun Shells: Magnum and Slug rounds now have a higher chance of recovering a hull whenever fired off.<br />* BBs: Can now be crafted from and to Lead.<br /><br />Armors<br />* Around 70 new armors and headgear, including classics (Hardened T-51b Power Armor), cut content, uniques (Van Graff Heavy Armor) and variants of existing armors (Brotherhood of Steel Combat Armor). They are perfectly integrated and balanced to fit all playstyles.<br />* Rebalance of the Light, Medium and Heavy armors. Medium and Heavy will weight less and have some DR (more for the Heavy) with their DT to be better protections.<br />* All glasses now only take the &#34;Eyeglasses&#34; slot instead of both the &#34;Eyeglasses&#34; and &#34;Mask&#34; slots. It means you can now wear glasses with certain headgear you couldn&#39;t use before.<br />* All items that had no DT before now at least gives 1 DT, or 1 DR if they are too light to be of any protection. This is because NPCs can only repair apparel items that gives at least a little amount of protection. That way, every apparel item can be repaired by NPCs without impacting balance too much.<br />* Other items were overhauled for a better coherence - for example, before, some hats had DT were other did not. The Boomers outfits, which are just leather jackets, had 4 DT when the Kings Outfit had 0. This kind of incoherence has been fixed.<br />* Helmets are now divided into Light (normal), Medium (Combat Helmets, Riot Helmets), and Heavy (Metal Helmets), just like armors. They will usually match the category of their main armor set. You can&#39;t repair a Power Helmet with a Baseball Cap anymore, but most headgears were edited to have more health and to be easier to cross-repair (ex: using a Decanus Helmet to repair a Legionary Helmet wasn&#39;t possible before).<br />* Most faction armors were renamed to properly show their faction and to make armor sorting easier. For example, the &#34;Trooper Helmet&#34; is now the &#34;NCR Trooper Helmet&#34;, the &#34;Raider Blastmaster Armor&#34; is now the &#34;Fiend Blastmaster Armor&#34;, etc.<br />* Cass&#39; Hat: Has been made playable, and can be removed from her at will.<br />* Chinese Stealth Armor: Can now be found with a separated Chinese Stealth Helmet, which has NVG capacity.<br />* Dirty Pre-War Businesswear: Fixed it not having a proper female gray texture.<br />* Enclave Officer Outfit: Female &#34;disappearing arm&#34; bug fixed.<br />* Grimy Pre-War Businesswear: Fixed it using the same textures as the Dirty version.<br />* NCR Ranger Patrol Armor: &#34;Power Armor Stance&#34; bug fixed.<br />* Pimpboy 3 Billion : Female mesh added.<br />* Rebreather: Isn&#39;t a quest item anymore. Also, it now correctly gives DT instead of DR.<br />* T-45d Power Armor: Now use US Army decals instead of Brotherhood ones.<br />* Tortiseshell Glasses: Renamed &#34;Tortoiseshell Glasses&#34;. Slightly more common, they were ultra-rare before.<br />* Vault 34 Security Helmet: Fixed to look like the Fo3 Vault Security Helmets.<br />* Veronica&#39;s Hood: Has been made playable, and can be removed from her at will.<br /><br />Creatures<br />* Cazadors: Attack range value upped to be slightly less than the original 1.0 one, but more than the edited 1.4 one.<br />* ED-E: The un-upgraded version of ED-E was not flagged as a &#34;Flier&#34; creature, and thus was vulnerable to land mines and other ground hazards. The upgraded Energy Zap won&#39;t have an idle sound anymore, and will have the same projectile as the Pulse Gun/LAER rather than the one of the Alien Blaster.<br />* Feral Ghouls: Won&#39;t give Good Karma when killed anymore. NCR Trooper Ghouls and Vault Security Ghouls will now have DT because of their armor.<br />* Lakelurk: Will now drop more Lakelurk Meat.<br />* Legion Mongrels: Now run slightly faster, and have the &#34;Tough Dog&#34; ability (2DT, like Vicious Dogs).<br />* NCR Guard Dogs: They are now German Shepherd instead of Vicious Dogs.<br />* Nightkins: Their &#34;Nightkin Toughness&#34; ability now correctly gives them DT instead of DR.<br />* Sentry Bot: Unconscious animations fixed. Head slightly harder to shoot in VATS.<br />* Spore Plants: Can now drop Spore Plant Pods upon death.<br /><br />Dialogs:<br />* Fixed the three Kings guarding Freeside&#39;s north gate having silent dialogs.<br />* You can now properly give 500 caps to the Vegas Medical Clinic.<br />* Dazzle: You now properly require the Cherchez La Femme perk rather than the Black Widow one to have cheap sex as a woman.<br /><br />Faction Armors Overhaul<br />* Non-humanoid companions such as Rex, ED-E and Lily won&#39;t drop faction armors to the ground anymore.<br />* If you have a positive Reputation with a faction, you won&#39;t &#34;lose&#34; that reputation back to neutral when wearing their armors.<br />* No more annoying faction warning pop-ups that appears on changing the worn armor to a faction armor.<br />* Khans armors will now makes you friendly with the Fiends. Cut dialogs with Bert Gunnarsson, Cook-Cook, Driver Nephi and Violet are thus unlocked.<br />* Wearing a Brotherhood/Khans armor won&#39;t make you hostile with the NCR and vice-versa if you made the right in-game alliances.<br /><br />FormLists<br />* All the FormLists were updated to contain the proper items. For example, you won&#39;t be stolen your bedroll kit at the entrance of the Fort anymore. The various weapon perks will work with all the relevant weapons, you and your companions will be able to slip the proper Holdout weapons into Casinos, etc.<br /><br />Ingestibles<br />* Around 15 new food item, including Cheezy Poofs, Brahmin Cheese, Nuka-Cola Quantum and various military rations.<br />* Raw Meats: will now all have a Strength reducer modifier unless you have the Lead Belly perk or a Food Sanitizer. Lakelurk meat is not included due its fishy nature.<br />* Steaks: will now all be more nutritious than raw meat.<br />* Stews (and Noodles): will now all restore some dehydration.<br />* Food Sanitizer: Has been added back into the game. It&#39;ll slightly increase the quantity of HPs restored by food and will negate the reduced Agility/Strength/Endurance effects associated with some kinds of food items.<br />* Stimpak: Weight set to 0.25.<br />* Super Stimpak: Weight set to 0.5.<br />* Wasteland Omelet: Now have a damage bonus to make it closer to other high-level food items (Brahmin Wellington, Yao Guai Steak).<br /><br />Leveled Items<br />* Fixed the possibility of Hidden Valley Paladins spawning with a T-51b Power Armor and a T-45d Power Helmet.<br />* 9mm Round, +P: Will now be more common - it was missing from the leveled list of special ammunitions.<br />* Plasma Grenade: Fixed a bug where vendors would sell less grenades than intended.<br />* Pulse Grenade: Fixed a bug where vendors would sell less grenades than intended.<br /><br />Loading Screens<br />* Replaced many loading tips with more specific, more helpful New Vegas references. Text mentioning Fallout3 items and skills was mainly removed and replaced with New Vegas lore and gameplay. New Vegas perks take a much higher priority than old Fallout3 perks, especially the less useful ones.<br />* Many new screens were added with tidbits of information from the Fallout New Vegas: Prima Official Game Guide, the Van Buren project, J.E. Sawyer&#39;s Fallout RPG and The Vault wiki.<br />* Many new screens were added with information about the Brotherhood of Steel. They are only used in the Brotherhood bunkers.<br /><br />Misc Items<br />* New item: Vault Water Canteens. They behave like the Pre-Order Vault 13 Canteen (except that the &#34;you take a sip from your Canteen&#34; message happens only once) but are home-made by the FOOK team.<br />* A lot of items now use their own unique icons rather than the generic junk one.<br />* Fission Battery: Replaced many static Fission Batteries with actual items that you can loot. Left behind all the batteries that were obviously intended as power sources for nearby lamps, such as in Primm and in Goodsprings.<br />* Rocket Souvenir: Isn&#39;t a quest item anymore, so it can be sold, bought or discarded at will. It now has a Weight, and is also a crafting item.<br /><br />NPCs<br />* Bert Gunnarsson: Will now accept to heal you if you have a limb crippled or are hurt in any other way, rather than just checking your Health.<br />* Boone: Can&#39;t be stripped naked anymore (sorry ladies). He&#39;ll now always wear at least an unplayable version of the Merc Grunt Outfit.<br />* Cass: Now has the correct tagged Skills, according to her dialogs (Explosives, Guns, Unarmed). Before, she had Melee Weapons, Guns and Sneak.<br />* Dawes: Won&#39;t shoot you after you pay your way into the NCRCF when wearing a Powder Ganger outfit.<br />* Crimson Caravan Traders: Will now work like Traveling Merchants.<br />* Emily Ortal: Unlocked a dialog tree about her relationship with Benny.<br />* Isaac: Won&#39;t lock himself in his house anymore.<br />* Ranger Andy: Fixed him not talking to you when trying to teach you the Ranger Takedown if you had a too low Unarmed skill.<br />* Raul: will now let you repair items at the Lucky 38 if you bought the Workbench upgrade. Will now also be in a proper Sandbox mode while in the Lucky 38.<br />* Poindexter: Is now a Caravan player.<br />* Vulpes Inculta: Slight redesign to match his Collector&#39;s Edition card and the female Caesar&#39;s Legion Courier&#39;s ending slides.<br /><br />Object Effects<br />* Most hats and caps will now only give a Perception bonus if (and only if) the player is outdoor and if the hour is between 6 AM and 6 PM - it&#39;s supposed to help against the sun.<br />* You can now toggle the Object Effects in the FOOK Menu. For example, you can only enable the effects for unique armors, or only enable non-combat effects. Besides uniques, only low-level and/or faction armors have actual combat bonuses, as an incentive to not use only the usual Leather/Metal/Combat armor progression.<br /><br />Perk<br />* New perk: Communist. While using weapons of Chinese or Russian design, your shots are 20% more accurate and, regardless of ammunition used, you ignore an additional 4 points of a target&#39;s Damage Threshold. Vodka&#39;s dehydration is also ignored.<br />* Cherchez La Femme: Damage bonuses increased from 10% to 15% due to proportionally lower numbers of female characters in the game.<br />* Child at Heart: Perk unlocked&#33; Merchants underestimate your bargaining abilities because of your childish behavior and you will get better prices (-15%) from them. It will also unlock a handful of dialog options with children, and you may even have a chance to find the unique, lucky Barnabas Bear&#33;<br />* Cowboy: Damage bonuses reduced from 25% to 20%. Now also affects Throwing Hatchets (and variants).<br />* Demolition Expert: Now has only 2 ranks. Each rank grants +10% damage and +10% larger explosion radius.<br />* Hit the Deck: The DT bonus won&#39;t show up in the Pipboy anymore, but it will still be present when shot at.<br />* Lady Killer: Damage bonuses increased from 10% to 15% due to proportionally lower numbers of female characters in the game.<br />* Lead Belly: Now negates the Strength penalty from eating raw meat, but doesn&#39;t make the Food Sanitizer useless as it doesn&#39;t remove penalties associated to other kind of food.<br />* Meltdown: Now only triggers from plasma weapon kills.<br />* Ninja: Now properly adds 15% to the current Critical Chance instead of multiplying the current Critical Chance by 1.15. Set to require either Unarmed or Melee Weapon skill levels.<br />* Piercing Strike: Set to require either Unarmed or Melee Weapon skill levels.<br />* Plasma Spaz: Now also increases attack rate with plasma weapons by 20%.<br />* Pyromaniac: Now require the Energy Weapons skill instead of the Explosives one.<br />* Rad Absorption: Now decreases radiation 10x faster.<br />* Stonewall: The DT bonus won&#39;t show up in the Pipboy anymore, but it will still be present when shot at. DT bonus vs. Melee/Unarmed weapons increased from 5 to 10.<br />* Slayer: Now also increases attack rate with melee and unarmed weapons by 30% (previously only decreased their AP cost). Set to require either Unarmed or Melee Weapon skill levels.<br />* Super Slam: Set to require either Unarmed or Melee Weapon skill levels.<br />* Terrifying Presence: Enemies now also have -20% chances of hitting you with a Critical Hit.<br />* Unstoppable Force: Set to require either Unarmed or Melee Weapon skill levels.<br /><br />Quests<br />* I Fought the Law: The NCRCF&#39;s Alarm can now be stopped using the Warden&#39;s Terminal.<br />* My Kind of Town: Deputies will now show up when the NCR and Meyer routes are completed.<br /><br />Rebalance<br />* Several Faction Leaders and other named NPCs have been rebalanced - for example, Head Paladin Hardin of Hidden Valley was previously level 11, making him as bad as an unexperienced BoS Paladin. He&#39;s now a level 23 killer. Chief Hanlon was worse than a low-level Ranger, and so on.<br />* Created and edited a handful of classes to have a better NPC lineup, from untrained (Bandits/Thugs), to professionals (Caravan Guards/Gangers/Legionaries), to skilled (Casino Family, Great Khan, NCR Rangers), to very skilled (Centurions).<br />* Many NPCs that had a wrong class (ex: Paladin Ramos being of the Slaver class, some Legionaries having Vault Dwellers stats, and so on) have been fixed, so expect them to be a little tougher.<br />* 1st Recon soldiers (and former members) are now much, much better sharpshooters.<br />* Benny now have the stats of the family leader he&#39;s supposed to be.<br />* Brotherhood of Steel members were buffed with implants to represent their technological edge.<br />* The Boomers will now also use U.S. Army and paratroopers weapons like the Assault and Marksman Carbines alongside some Combat Armors.<br />* Caesar&#39;s Legion soldiers now have the proper levels and stats to represent their physical fitness and their experience.<br />* Casino Guards are now strong enough to represent their tribal upbringing.<br />* Great Khans are now all of the same strength, instead of the females being half as weak as the males (good one, Obsidian). They are roughly on par with Legionaries, with some advantages and drawbacks.<br />* Gun Runners Guards are not pitifully weak anymore.<br />* Fiends will now all have the skills to use their Energy Weapons and won&#39;t give Good Karma on death anymore. Special Fiend variants can appear, each buffed with a particular drug. For example, a Fiend Steadshooter can spawn instead of a Fiend rifleman, pumped full of Steady.<br />* Kings Gang Members are now a match for the various Thugs of Freeside.<br /><br />Recipes<br />* You can now use your Sneak skill at a Workbench to paint some Combat and Power Armors into other variants.<br />* Recipes needing raw meat will now require a Steak instead. That way, you&#39;re not locked out of crafting high-level recipes with mid-level meat.<br />* New craftable weapons: Acid-Blood Grenade, Auto Axe, Cryolator, Dart Gun, Deathclaw Gauntlet, Mantis Gauntlet, Nuka Quantum-Grenade, Railway Rifle, Rock-It Launcher, Shishkebab, Spiked Bat, Tribal BB Gun.<br />* New campfire recipes: Mac & Cheese & Cram, Mole Rat Wonder Meat, Strange Meat(with Cannibal perk), Strange Meat Pie (with Cannibal perk), Ultrajet (with proper recipe), Yao Guai Steak.<br />* New workbench recipe: Armored Vault Suit, Cherry Bomb, Hardened T-51b Power Armor, Nuka-Cola Quantum, Tin Can.<br /><br />Vendors<br />* Boulder City: Ike doesn&#39;t share the same vendor chest with Trudy (Goodsprings) anymore.<br />* Camp McCarran: A Far Go Trader has set up shop near the truck garage. The Far Go Traders are known for selling a great variety of outfits and rare armors.<br />* Camp McCarran: Sergeant Daniel Contreras has been fixed - he won&#39;t wear the armors he is sold anymore, he will properly reset his caps every three days, and he&#39;ll only sell his chems if you finished his delivery missions first.<br />* Cottonwood Cove: A Legion quartermaster, Armicustos Atellus, has settled in the Storage building. Since the Legion mostly relies on looting to equip their soldiers, he doesn&#39;t sell much and doesn&#39;t have much Caps, but he does have an interesting supply of Throwing weapons and Legion money.<br />* Freeside: Mick & Ralph&#39;s shop heavily fixed. Ralph will now properly sell the miscellaneous items around the store. Mick will now properly sell some nifty Fallout 3 weapons as well as case boxes. Both of their inventories will properly reset as any other vendors, and that does include Mick&#39;s secret storage.<br />* Hidden Valley: Knight Torres inventory fixed to reset like every other vendors.<br />* Mojave Outpost: A Van Graff Sales Representative has just opened a low-level Energy Weapons shop in the unoccupied Brahmin pen.<br />* Nellis AFB: The Boomers now sells much more Explosives.<br />* Primm: Johnson Nash now sells a few low-tier Energy Weapons.<br />* Silver Rush: Gloria Van Graff&#39;s inventory fixed to reset like every other vendors. Also, the LVLIs were fixed to properly give better weapons at later levels, and she can now also sell the weapons just in front of her.<br />* The Strip: Sarah will now sell the Armored Vault 13 Jumpsuit and a Vault 21 Water Canteen as unique items. She will also sell Vault 21 Cards.<br />* The Thorn: An awesome merchant specialized in melee/unarmed weapons, heavy armors and booze has just opened.<br /><br />Weapons<br />* Around 60 new weapons, including classics (Wattz Laser Pistol/Rifle), cut content, uniques (VT-191 &#34;Murdelizer&#34;) and variants of existing weapons (White Legs Storm-Drum). They are perfectly integrated and balanced to fit all playstyles.<br />* Most vanilla Guns and Energy Weapons were renamed to have either their official name (Glock 86 Plasma Pistol), a classic Fallout-inspired name (HK MP10 10mm SMG) or a guess using vanilla materials (AER12 Tri-Laser Rifle).<br />* Added iron sights to several Energy Weapons: Alien Blaster, Laser Pistol, Laser Rifle and all uniques and DLCs variants.<br />* Fixed companions weapons: Boone&#39;s Scoped Hunting Rifle (will now use proper Hunting Rifle sounds), Lily&#39;s Assault Carbine (now silenced). They will now use also special ammunition if given to them, but they will be consumed, unlike their unlimited base ammo. All of the companions&#39; weapons also have a mod (Cass&#39; Shotgun has a choke, for example).<br />* Recharger weapons (Pistol, Rifle, MF Hyperbreeder Alpha) can now be used by NPCs - they were previously thinking they were always out of ammo.<br />* Several weapons can now be crafted, like the Deathclaw Gauntlet, the Mantis Gauntlet and the Shishkebab.<br />* Several weapons are not quest items anymore and can be removed from the inventory, like the Codac R9000 Camera and Loyal&#39;s Detonator.<br />* There is now unique ejected shell casings meshes for all Guns calibers, such as .22LR, 9mm, .45 Auto, .308, and so on.<br />* Binoculars: Now have a much better zoom and an integrated Night Vision Effect.<br />* Euclid&#39;s C-Finder: Weight reduced to 2.<br />* Incendiary Grenade: Enemies dieing from a critical hit wont be reduced to plasma goo anymore.<br />* Plasma Rifle: Fixed the rifle using sounds from the Plasma Pistol.<br />* Thermic Lance: Now does Fire damages on crits and on VATS special attacks. Considered a Pyromaniac weapon.<br />* Trail Carbine: Vanilla cut mods added back.<br /><br />World<br />* 15 new map markers, including Fremont Street, the Great Khan Armory and the McCarran Supply Shack.<br />* Camp Forlorn Hope: Removed the annoying Bloatflies of the graveyard.<br />* Freeside: The Kings will now only bring you gifts every three days instead of every single time you enter the zone.<br />* Primm: The dead Sheriff and Courier will now disappear once the town has been cleaned out and given a new sheriff.<br /><br />===============<br />Requirements:<br />===============<br /><br />* Fallout: New Vegas 1.4.0.525<br />* Fallout Mod Manager (FOMM), http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/36901<br />* (Recommended Option) Fallout: New Vegas DLCs: Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, Lonesome Road, Gun Runners&#39; Arsenal<br />* (Recommended Option) New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE) v2 beta 12 or higher, http://nvse.silverlock.org<br />* (Recommended Option) The Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) 1.2, http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42507<br /><br />===============<br />Installation:<br />===============<br /><br />In addition to a required files and a couple of ESM and ESP files, FOOK-NV includes many &#34;loose files&#34;, which are mainly fixed meshes and texture replacements for vanilla armors, creatures, items and guns. The loose files are optional though recommended, because they enhance greatly the game.<br /><br />0. Check the mod page for the latest news, resources and hotfixes.<br />1. Download the latest versions of the Required Files and/or Optional Files. You&#39;ll need the following : &#34;FOOK v1-13 Required Files&#34;, &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34; and optionally the &#34;FOOK v1-13 Optional Files&#34;. Also any optional patch(s) that may apply to your game or load order (like compatibility patches).<br />2. Unzip all the files to a temporary location.<br />3. Examine and familiarize yourself with the contents of all the folders, then READ the ReadMes.<br /><br />There are two different options for Installing, Upgrading and Un-installing FOOK: the &#34;Automated Method Using Fallout Mod Manager&#34; and the &#34;Manual Method&#34;. Both options require FOMM and are detailed as follows:<br /><br />FOMM Auto Installation:<br /><br />Veteran FOMM Users:<br />Install/activate (in this order): &#34;FOOK v1-13 Required Files&#34;, &#34;FOOK v1-13 Optional Files&#34; (if used), &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34;, then any patch(s) you might need. If you don&#39;t have ALL the official DLCs (excepted Courier&#39;s Stash), be sure to remove both the &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esm&#34; and &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esp&#34; files from the &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34; folder before installing/activating. See below for Load Order recommendations and detailed instructions for upgrading and un-installing.<br /><br />Novice FOMM Users:<br />1. Relocate all unzipped folders to your mods folder. If you don&#39;t already have a mods folder, create one entitled &#34;New Vegas Mods&#34; (for example) and locate it in your Fallout: New Vegas Directory (Not Data Folder&#33;).<br />2. Do you have ALL the official DLCs? If &#34;Yes&#34;, proceed to &#34;Step 3&#34;. If &#34;No&#34;, open the &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34; folder and locate the two files: &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esm&#34; and &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esp&#34;. Delete both of these files. *Note that if you install the official DLCs in the future, you&#39;ll need these two files, so you will have to redownload/reinstall the &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34; archive.<br />3. Launch FOMM, click &#34;Package Manager&#34;.<br />4. Locate &#34;Add FOMod&#34;, scroll to &#34;Create From Folder&#34;, navigate to &#34;FOOK v1-13 Required Files&#34;, double-click it then click &#34;OK&#34;. Once added to the &#34;Package Manager&#34;, highlight it and click &#34;Activate&#34;.<br />5. Repeat &#34;Step 4&#34;, this time adding and activating &#34;FOOK v1-13 Optional Files&#34; (if used). IMPORTANT: when activating this second part (and all subsequent parts), an &#34;Upgrade?&#34; window will appear: &#34;A different version...(blah blah blah)...install the new FOMod normally&#34;. Click &#34;NO&#34; to this every time.<br />6. Repeat &#34;Step 4&#34; once again, this time adding and activating &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34;. If you&#39;re using a patch(s), install/activate them LAST, in the same manner.<br />7. Close the Package Manager. In FOMM be sure ALL the check boxes next to the files you&#39;ve just activated are &#34;ticked&#34;.<br />8. Arrange the Load Order (see below).<br /><br />Manual Installation:<br /><br />1. Copy ALL the contents of the unzipped folders to the Fallout New Vegas Data folder (Fallout New Vegas/Data). By default, this is usually: Program Files/Steam/Steamapps/Common/Fallout New Vegas/Data.<br />2. Launch Fallout Mod Manager and place a tickmark in the checkboxes beside the FOOK - New Vegas.esm and .esp file(s) and all other FOOK files/patches you may have installed.<br />3. Arrange the Load Order (see below).<br /><br />The Mod Configuration Menu / Darnified UI Installation:<br />If you are using The Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) 1.2 by Pelinor, or MCM and Darnified UI (DarnUI) v0.0.4 by Darn - pre-edited &#34;start_menu.xml&#34; files are provided for your convenience located in &#34;Fallout New Vegas/Data/Menus/Options/&#34;. Copy the XML file of your choosing, paste it in the same directory, and rename it to &#34;start_menu.xml&#34;.<br />- If you use MCM with FOOKNV, you would copy/paste/rename &#34;start_menu - VANILLA MCM.xml&#34; to &#34;start_menu.xml&#34;.<br />- If you use MCM and DarnUI with FOOKNV, you would copy/paste/rename &#34;start_menu - DARN MCM.xml&#34; to &#34;start_menu.xml&#34;.<br />For more instructions about how to install MCM and DarnUI, check their respective mod pages.<br /><br />===============<br />Load Order:<br />===============<br /><br />FalloutNV.esm must go first, &#34;FOOK - New Vegas.esm&#34; should go near the top of your load order. &#34;FOOK - New Vegas.esp&#34; should be the very last item of your load order to avoid conflicts.<br /><br />Standard Load Order WITHOUT the New Vegas DLCs:<br /><br />FalloutNV.esm<br />FOOK - New Vegas.esm<br />&lt;any other mod&gt;<br />FOOK - New Vegas.esp<br />&lt;any Patch(s) you may have installed&gt;<br /><br />Standard Load Order WITH the New Vegas DLCs. You need ALL the New Vegas DLCs (excepted Courier&#39;s Stash). As you can see, similar recommendations as above for &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esm&#34; and &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esp&#34;:<br /><br />FalloutNV.esm<br />DeadMoney.esm<br />HonestHearts.esm<br />OldWorldBlues.esm<br />LonesomeRoad.esm<br />GunRunnersArsenal.esm<br />FOOK - New Vegas.esm<br />FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esm<br />&lt;any other mod&gt;<br />FOOK - New Vegas.esp<br />FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esp<br />&lt;any Patch(s) you may have installed&gt;<br /><br />We don&#39;t plan to have separate files for people who only have one of the official DLCs. Note that Fallout Mod Manager is only required once, to create your load order. After that, you can launch the game as you want.<br /><br />===============<br />Upgrading:<br />===============<br /><br />FOMM Auto Upgrading:<br />0. Download the latest file(s)/patches(s) you wish to upgrade, unzip to a temporary location and examine/familiarize yourself with the contents of the folders.<br />1. Launch FOMM, click &#34;Package Manager&#34;.<br />2. Locate the mod file you wish to replace, highlight it and click &#34;Deactivate&#34;. Right-click on the mod file in the Package Manager and delete it. Repeat if there are more than one mod file to upgrade.<br />3. Open your &#34;New Vegas Mods&#34; folder, locate and delete the old version(s). Replace with the new. Close the folder.<br />4. Install/activate the new mod files as you normally would (refer to the &#34;Installation&#34; instructions above).<br />5. Double check your Load Order and rearrange if necessary (see &#34;Load Order&#34; above).<br /><br />Upgrading Manually:<br />0. Download the latest file(s)/patches(s) you wish to upgrade, unzip to a temporary location and examine/familiarize yourself with the contents of the folders.<br />1. &#34;Copy and replace&#34; ALL the contents of the unzipped folders you&#39;re Upgrading to the Fallout New Vegas Data folder (default location: Program Files/Steam/Steamapps/Common/Fallout New Vegas/Data).<br />2. Launch Fallout Mod Manager and place a tickmark in the checkboxes beside the mod files you&#39;ve just Upgraded.<br />3. Double check your Load Order and rearrange if necessary (see &#34;Load Order&#34; above).<br />4. After upgrading, launch your game and load your latest relevant save. Open the FOOK Menu in your inventory and &#34;Set all options to FOOK defaults&#34; then close (doing this may move the camera slightly apart. If this occurs, save, quit, then reload the save).<br /><br />IMPORTANT:<br />1. After upgrading, launch your game and load your latest relevant save. Open the FOOK Menu in your inventory and &#34;Set all options to FOOK defaults&#34; then close (doing this may move the camera slightly apart. If this occurs, save, quit, then reload the save).<br />2. Wait four days (of in-game time) in an unoccupied location to reset the cells and NPCs inventories. A player&#39;s house is a good place for this. Remember you can toggle off Hardcore Mode in the game options if you don&#39;t want to eat a lot of food and drink a lot of water during those four days.<br />3. Save your game and quit. This procedure is just to make sure your save is updated to work with the latest features.<br /><br />===============<br />Un-installation:<br />===============<br /><br />Note: Many required and all loose files are simply overrides for already existing resources included in vanilla New Vegas, and can be left as is or overridden without issue to fit user tastes.<br /><br />FOMM Auto Un-installation:<br />1. Launch FOMM, click &#34;Package Manager&#34;.<br />2. Locate the mod file(s) you wish to un-install, highlight and click &#34;Deactivate&#34;. Right-click on the mod file(s) in the Package Manager and delete.<br />3. Open your &#34;New Vegas Mods&#34; folder, locate and delete the mod file(s).

Untick all the FOOK .esm and .esp file(s) and any patch(s) (if any).<br />2. Delete by hand the files/folders associated with the mod from your Data Folder.<br /><br />IMPORTANT:<br />1. After uninstalling, launch your game and load your latest relevant save.<br />2. Wait four days (of in-game time) in an unoccupied location to reset the cells and NPCs inventories. A player&#39;s house is a good place for this. Remember you can toggle off Hardcore Mode in the game options if you don&#39;t want to eat a lot of food and drink a lot of water during those four days.<br />3. Save your game and quit. This procedure is just to make sure your save is updated to be completely FOOK-free.<br /><br />===============<br />Compatibility:<br />===============<br /><br />Any mods editing the vanilla ammunition, armors, leveled lists, NPCs and weapons will most probably conflict with FOOK-NV. Please remember that conflicts do not always mean bugs, it&#39;s just that some of the FOOK features will be overriden.<br /><br />FOOK-NV can override these changes by having the ESP file placed below the other mod in the load order. If you wish so, you can also just keep the FOOK features overriden, or even try to create a merged patch. For simple incompatibilities like armors and ingestible, it should work without problems.<br /><br />The FOOK Team is not responsible for any incompatibilities or bugs stemming from using non-compatible mods in your load order.<br /><br />===============<br />Recommended/Compatible Mods:<br />===============<br /><br />Recommended mods are always compatible with FOOK, but remember to check that all those mods and the corresponding compatibility patches are up-to-date.<br /><br />Recommended:<br />* New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE) v2b12 or better. Don&#39;t miss the cool NVSE features: http://nvse.silverlock.org/<br />* The Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) 1.2 by Pelinor. Configure all of your favorites mods in the same place: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42507<br />* WME - Weapon Mod Expansion. A massive expansion to the New Vegas weapon modification system, adding over 150 new modification options to the game. Made by Jonnyeah, a FOOK Team member: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/37576<br /><br />About Project Nevada:<br />* Remember that Project Nevada is split up into different modules.<br />* Project Nevada Core and Cyberware modules are compatible with FOOK (and any other mod).<br />* As for the Equipment module, there&#39;s a lot of overlap between the two, so just pick one or you will end up with a lot of duplicate weapons.<br />* Rebalance module should also be compatible with FOOK, since most settings can be set to &#39;Vanilla&#39; which will stop PN from changing the settings and other mods can alter them instead.<br /><br />Compatible:<br />* BIS - Brumbek&#39;s Inventory Sorting, by Brumbek. This mod renames every single item you can pick up to sort your inventory: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/38604<br />* Robert Fook Armor, by Nivea. This mod adds Robert male versions of all skin showing FOOK New Vegas armors: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42336<br />* FOOK n Breeze Armor Patch, by Keleigh3000. This mod adds Breeze male versions of all skin showing FOOK New Vegas armors: http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/50771<br /><br />Incompatible:<br />* Arwen&#39;s Camera Mod: The NVSE Camera Options in the FOOK menus makes this mod incompatible. You can emulate the mod by enabling the FOOK Camera Feature Options and using the arrow keys to adjust your camera close to Arwen&#39;s setting (NVSE required).<br />* Perk Every Level: You can emulate the mod by choosing another perk/level rate in the FOOK menus (NVSE required).<br />* Mods changing the weapons animations: You need to re-install those mods after installing FOOK.<br /><br />Outdated Mods:<br />* nVamp: The current nVamp version was made for FOOK-NV 0.70, which has gone a long way since. Don&#39;t use nVamp.<br /><br />===============<br />Bugs/Issues:<br />===============<br /><br />Please, remember to update keep up to date your Fallout: New Vegas game, your Fallout Mod Manager program, the New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE) and The Mod Configuration Menu (MCM). FOOK is always made to work with the latest tools and updates.<br /><br />If you use a mod that needs a Compatibility Patch to work with FOOK, make sure the patch is properly up-to-date to work with both new versions of your mod and of FOOK. Otherwise, problems will happen.<br /><br />Vanilla Bugs:<br />* A vendor doesn&#39;t refresh his inventory: Have you properly waited four days (of in-game time) in an unoccupied location, as described above? If yes, enter the vendor&#39;s shop and, without interacting with anyone, save and quit your game. Re-launch the game and then use the &#34;Continue&#34; option to load your save. The vendor should have refreshed. Mick & Ralph are both commonly having this bug.<br />* Some NPCs have a very pale face: You must open your (install folder)/Fallout New Vegas/Fallout_default.ini file and change the &#34;bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=0&#34; line to &#34;bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=1&#34;, and then open the Game Launcher to actually update the Fallout.ini that is in My Documents.<br />* Some NPCS are naked/have a weird inventory: An engine bug will sometimes not correctly refresh named and unnamed NPCs. Should you encounter this problem, just open the console (http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Gamebryo_console_commands), click on the npc and type &#34;resurrect&#34;. The NPC will be correctly refreshed with its new FOOK gear.<br />* NPCs talks with an echo and there is heavy outdoor lag: You must open the Fallout_default.ini file mentioned above and make sure that the &#34;bEnableEnviroEffectsOnPC&#34; line is set to zero, and then open the Game Launcher to actually update the Fallout.ini that is in My Documents.<br /><br />Incompatibilies with other mods:<br />* Some NPCs with rifles are shooting at their feet: If you&#39;re using a mod like New Vegas - Re-Animated and Ironsights Animation, you need to reinstall them after you&#39;ve installed FOOK.<br />* The Inventory Sorter doesn&#39;t work: Are you using Project Nevada ? If yes, use their own Inventory Sorter, as the one in FOOK is disabled when detecting Project Nevada.<br /><br />No other known issues so far, please let us know if you find any.<br /><br />===============<br />History:<br />===============<br /><br />1.13, 16/03/2014 - Updated textures for some weapons and a handful of fixes.<br />1.12, 11/02/2012 - Handful of fixes for a crash-on-exit issue and faction armors.<br />1.11, 09/11/2012 - Small tweaks to the mod that doesn&#39;t come with updated Data or Loose Files.<br />1.10, 03/10/2012 - Adding support for the JSawyer mod, handful of new weapons, lot of bugs fixes.

You should ask for the original authors of the things you like most if you wish to use them&#33; See FOOK_Credits.txt for a listing of the original authors of FOOK-NV&#39;s components.<br /><br />If you want to use FOOK-NV in your mod, get in touch with us and we&#39;ll do our best to assist you. But please, don&#39;t add FOOK to a modpack, we like to keep control of each released version so we can properly help our users if they have problems.

Mojave Arsenal 1.16.0
====================================================
By PushTheWinButton for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[center][color=#fff2cc][size=6][b]Mojave Arsenal[/b][/size][/color]
<br />[size=3][color=#999999]Requirements:
<br />All Official DLC (except Courier's Stash)[/color]
<br />[url=http://nvse.silverlock.org/]New Vegas Script Extender[/url]
<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277/?]JIP LN NVSE Plugin[/url]
<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66927]JohnnyGuitar NVSE Plugin[/url]﻿[/size][/center]
<br />
<br />[line]
<br />[color=#fff2cc][size=5][b]Description[/b][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Mojave Arsenal is a collection of simple gameplay changes and features related to weapons and ammunition. Here's a quick overview of the features.[/size]
<br />
<br />[center][b][u][size=4]Expanded Loot[/size][/u][/b][/center]
<br />
<br />[size=3]In the vanilla game, ammo variants, reloading parts, and weapon mods were almost exclusively obtainable only from merchants (and by that I mean: they only appear as loot in Lonesome Road, and in some cases this is only at very high levels). I always found this pretty dumb. What's the point of adding cool new items and crafting parts to the game if they don't feel like part of the world?[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Mojave Arsenal makes these items available as loot, each of which can be enabled or disabled individually in the Mod Configuration Menu. The chances for each type of item have been well balanced, so you won't be finding valuable weapon mods in every container, and you won't be gaining masses of extra ammo. Item locations are appropriate to the type of item:[/size]
<br />
<br />[list]
<br />[*][size=3]Ammo variants are found in place of their regular counterparts;[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Reloading parts are found alongside the relevant ammo;[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Weapon mods are always found alongside weapons.[/size]
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />[size=3]As an added bonus, surplus rounds can be found in higher quantities than other ammo types to reflect their lower value.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Item distribution is carried out in real-time, and so will adapt to changes made by your current mods. This means that mods which add new weapons or weapon mods are supported automatically - so yes, [u]WME and WMX are supported without the need for a patch[/u].[/size]
<br />
<br />[center][b][u][size=4]Better Item Naming[/size][/u][/b][/center]
<br />
<br />[size=3]The vanilla game isn't very consistent when it comes to ammo naming. For example, regular 9mm rounds are called "9mm Round", whereas 9mm hollow point rounds are called "9mm, Hollow Point". It's fairly hit and miss when the game abbreviates ammo names: hollow point rounds are called "Hollow Point", whereas jacketed hollow point rounds are called "JHP", etc. The same goes for ammo crafting recipes, and items added by the DLCs seem to change things up even more. As this mod makes ammo variants more common, these inconsistencies can become more noticeable.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Therefore, all ammo and recipes now adhere to a common naming convention. Regular 9mm rounds are renamed to "9mm, FMJ", and the hollow point rounds become "9mm, HP", etc.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]In addition, all item name tags - (GRA), (Hand Load), (Junk), (Mad Bomber), and (Vigilant Recycler) - are removed from all items. These looked rather ugly in my opinion, and I never understood why the game wants to inform you what perks (or DLC) are associated with which items. I mean, is every item from Honest Hearts suffixed with "(Honest Hearts)"?[/size]
<br />
<br />[center][b][u][size=4]Better Crafting[/size][/u][/b][/center]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Recipes to craft and breakdown all ballistic ammo variants have been added based on vanilla conventions for Hand Load components and breakdown losses, and meticulously balanced. By default, all special ammo variants such as AP, HP, etc require the Hand Loader perk to craft, albeit with lower skill requirements than the respective cartridge's Hand Load. Optionally, you can disable the Hand Loader requirement for these rounds; in which case, .50MG Explosive, 12 Gauge Pulse, 12 Gauge Dragon's Breath, 12 Gauge Flechette, and 20 Gauge Pulse will still require the perk. Surplus, Special, .22LR Plinking, .223, and 12 Gauge Bean Bag rounds can be crafted without Hand Loader, but Surplus rounds require slightly higher skill due to their increased damage. Breakdown recipes for all ammo are available without Hand Loader, and have the same skill requirement as the standard cartridge (because you don't need to know how to make something to take it apart). Finally, empty case items for .22LR, .38 Special, .44 Special, and .223 have been added and distributed to the appropriate leveled lists, and are required/received for crafting/breaking-down rounds. The cases will also be received from firing the respective ammo, with the exception of .22LR, as it's a rimfire cartridge (thus crafting .22LR rounds also doesn't require primers).[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]To reduce clutter in crafting lists, energy ammo conversion and overcharge recipes are unavailable unless you have a Fission Battery in your inventory. This also represents the need for an extra source of power in order to craft the items. The Fission Battery is not consumed. In addition efficient recycling recipes have had the "Efficient" removed from their name. It's obvious they're more efficient - they require less parts...[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]The Mad Bomber perk from Gun Runners' Arsenal has been removed, and it is no longer required to craft any of the new explosive items. I didn't like that the perk's sole effect was to unlock new crafting recipes - that's what skills should be for. The efficient crafting recipes unlocked by Mad Bomber are removed, and the normal recipes have instead been modified to meet somewhere in the middle. The vanilla recipes were unnecessarily hard to craft in my opinion anyway. A Bottlecap Mine required 5 Cherry Bombs - seriously?![/size]
<br />
<br />[center][b][u][size=4]GRA Integration and Options[/size][/u][/b][/center]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Gun Runners' Arsenal has been more cleanly integrated with the vanilla game. As already mentioned, the (GRA) tag is removed from all the new items and challenges. The new variants of vanilla weapons, and their mods are instead tagged with (Custom), which represents the fact that the weapons have been modified to accommodate the new modifications. These items are still only available from merchants - I quite like this as it gives you something to spend you caps on, and represents the fact that these special custom weapons aren't commonly available to everyone in the wasteland.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]There is also the option to disable the custom weapon variants, if you'd prefer them to not be available. The same goes for the new unique weapons added by Gun Runners' Arsenal, as some people find them to be overpowered. The new MFC Grenades and optimised energy ammo recipes can also be disabled, as they can be considered quite overpowered when compared to other explosives and energy ammo variants.[/size]

<br />[size=3]You will be notified if any of the NVSE dependencies are missing.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Load order is not really important as this mod makes very few record edits.[/size]

NVBI Version 1 dot 55 1.55.0
====================================================
By Someguy2000 for Fallout:	New Vegas

[b]NEW VEGAS BOUNTIES I[/b]
<br />
<br />[b]THIS MOD REQUIRES [/b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/48925]THE SOMEGUYSERIES.ESM[/url] [b]VERSION 2.0[/b]
<br />
<br />[b]THIS MOD IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH MASTER UPDATE[/b]
<br />
<br />Stay abreast of the latest developments on [url=https://twitter.com/Someguy_Modder]Twitter[/url].
<br />
<br />Check out trailers, developer diaries, and mod reviews at [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/Someguy2000Modder]my Youtube channel[/url] or on [url=https://www.twitch.tv/someguy2000modder]Twitch[/url]﻿.
<br />
<br />Description:
<br />"New Vegas Bounties I" is the first installment in a planned series for Fallout: New Vegas. Upon initiating the quest, you'll be tasked with tracking down the most malevolent and vile assortment of outlaws in the Mojave Wasteland.
<br />
<br />Your targets will include rogue rangers, fiends, raiders, drug smugglers, cannibals, and pistoleros, to name a few. Your opponents are all designed to be boss-caliber, akin to the fiends in "Three-Card Bounty", and become gradually more difficult as you progress.
<br />
<br />At its core, New Vegas Bounties is an action mod; extreme violence and profanity are ubiquitous. In lieu of mind-boggling puzzles or "go collect x or y resource"-type quests,  you will be confronted with dangerous opponents who are designed to frustrate and kill you. You will be harried, ambushed, outnumbered, and outgunned. This is the path of a bounty hunter - take it or leave it.
<br />
<br />It includes 436 lines of fully-voiced dialogue (as of version 1.2). I will continue to polish the lip-syncing in future updates, as it is a time-consuming process (and I've gained new respect for voiced mods!). 
<br />
<br />If you love it, hate, or are just indifferent, please post comments. My mods live and die by users who provide feedback! 
<br />
<br />Balancing:
<br />This is an ongoing project, and I will adjust difficulty and rewards based on player feedback. Currently the mod will grant the player an addition perk for increased DT upon completion. (+ 2% DT)
<br />
<br />As of version 1.2, the mod includes the [Taunt] speech option in confrontations with the final boss; when this is selected it will dramatically enhance the difficulty of the fight.
<br />
<br />Compatibility:
<br />- I try to ensure that my mods are as low-impact/conflict as possible. Besides a handful of remote bunkers and a shack, this mod only consists of NPC's, so it should be conflict-free. Please let me know if anything arises.
<br />
<br />Voice Acting: Version 1.5+ introduces an expanded, much-improved voice acting cast:
<br />- Alex: IronsGrasp
<br />- Chesty: IronsGrasp
<br />- Chuck Bowdrie: Sirropoo
<br />- Cullen: PitchPerfect
<br />- Dallas Courtright: Zaf
<br />- Fred: Zaf
<br />- Jack: Ben Britton (The_Yellow_Dart)
<br />- Jasper: Sirropoo
<br />- Javier Sugar: PitchPerfect
<br />- Generic guard: 
<br />- Luke McCaffery: Zaf
<br />- Mago: PitchPerfect
<br />- Ricky: PitchPerfect
<br />- Rowdy Dalton: PitchPerfect
<br />- The Judge: MartinPurvis
<br />
<br />Credits:
<br />DavidRiggs: for letting me use his terrific pistol from FO3, "Sweet Revenge"
<br />
<br />Sebazz: Fixing the Iron Sights for "Sweet Revenge"
<br />
<br />Brigand231: Leveled Lists Fix (v1.5)

<br />
<br />With amazing mods from zzjay, i finally can make Veronica looks more beautiful (in my opinion). And then, maybe some people will like her new face too, so i decided to upload this mod on Nexus. I'm using two mods from zzjay, hair mod and face mod. You don't need to install original mods, everything already in this mod.
<br />
<br />  In pictures, she wearing outfit from zzjay's mod. The weapon from GaigeStorm. Holster gear from fLokii. Pistol Harness from Kewin568. They're not part this mod. And not as mod requirement too. Just for the show in photo session. But if you want them, here's the links :

FOOK v1-13 Optional Files 1.13.0
====================================================
By The FOOK Team for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

Name: FOOK - New Vegas<br />Version: 1.13<br />Date: 16/03/2014<br />Category: Gameplay Effects and Changes<br />Requirements: Fallout: New Vegas 1.4.0.525, Fallout Mod Manager, Fallout: New Vegas DLCs (optional), NVSE v2b12 (optional), The Mod Configuration Menu 1.2 (optional)<br />Author(s): The FOOK Team<br />Source: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34684<br /><br />===============<br />Description:<br />===============<br /><br />FOOK - New Vegas is an overhaul for the Fallout: New Vegas game. FOOK is a coherent and balanced overhaul, adding and fully integrating many bug fixes, new items, high quality retextures and gameplay features to the base game. It also has full support for the Fallout: New Vegas DLCs.<br /><br />===============<br />Latest features:<br />===============<br /><br />So yeah, two years after the last update, here&#39;s a new one&#33; Hope you will enjoy it. Thanks to Jonnyeah, Drithius and blove for their help and support.<br /><br />You can find gameplay spoilers about FOOK in the FOOK_FullNotes.txt file, including where you can find the unique weapons and armors of the mod.<br /><br />Remember - don&#39;t use the &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs&#34; ESM file if you don&#39;t own Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, Lonesome Road AND the Gun Runners&#39; Arsenal. The Courier&#39;s Stash is not required.<br /><br />1.13 Changes<br />------------<br /><br />Dead Money<br />* Fixed Ghost people having a Perception of 0, the value will be 1 now.<br />* Fixed the Holorifle&#39;s maximal health being set to 101.5% instead of 150% by the Holorifle reinforced components mod.<br /><br />Lonesome Road<br />* Red Victory Grenade Rifle is not considered a Grunt perk weapon anymore, but is now considered a Communist perk weapon.<br /><br />Gun Runners&#39; Arsenal<br />* Fixed Sleepytyme missing from the Improved Holdout weapons list.<br /><br />Armors<br />* Fixed all variants of the Radiation Suit and Hazmat Suit having disembodied hands in 1st person view.<br />* Fixed several Metal Armor variants not having correct normal maps.<br /><br />Leveled Items<br />* Fixed the .45 ACP and Railway Spikes ammo lists. They were spawning with either the full amount of ammunitions or nothing.<br /><br />Recipes<br />* Fixed the BBs crafting recipes to be less exploitable.<br /><br />Weapons<br />* Updated the textures of the following weapons: Marksman Carbine, Makarov PM, .44 Magnum Revolver, Taurus Raging Bull, Grenade Launcher, Grenade Rifle, Combat Shotgun, 9mm Submachine Gun, Gauss Rifle, VSS Vintorez and their uniques counterparts.<br />* New mods added to the Makarov PM, the Taurus Raging Bull and the FN FAL.<br />* Fixed lack of 3D sounds for all variants of the Power Fist.<br />* Fixed the Cryolator to spawn more spaced gibs to avoid clipping.<br />* Slight nerf of the Fiend Roaster.<br />* Added a cut icon for the Golden Gloves.<br /><br />===============<br />Details:<br />===============<br /><br />FOOK Menus<br />* To open them, equip the [FOOK Menu Hotkey] in your inventory or, if you have NVSE, just press O (not zero, O, the letter&#33; Press it for at least a second).<br />* There is an option to activate (in Doc Mitchell&#39;s house) the FOOK QA Boxes containing all of the game&#39;s items. You can also just open them on the fly using the right options. If you have NVSE, just press = (for at least a second) to open the proper menu.<br />* If you have NVSE, you can edit the game to give yourself a perk at each level, allow or disallow Repair in Combat, and much more&#33;<br />* You can also remove your Pipboy glove, give yourself the Power Armor Training perk, access an infinite Bag of Holding, and more&#33;<br />* FOOK also support the &#34;Mod Configuration Menu&#34;, and all of the FOOK Menus have been mirrored in MCM for your convenience.<br /><br />FOOK Global Features<br />* Bug fixing: FOOK brings to New Vegas thousands of little fixes that can&#39;t be described because they would be too numerous - for example, NPCs having the wrong class, weapons not counting for their respective perks, etc.<br />* Improved Character Generation: You can now play a Raider or an Old character. Many new presets from Fo3 NPCs included, such as Colonel Autumn or Dad. Finally, added an unused female haircut (Cherry Taste) and fixed disappearing eyebrows.<br />* Improved crafting: FOOK brings back the interesting weapon crafting part of Fallout 3 with both new and old weapons. The hunt for schematics will test your wits and your sense of exploration&#33;<br />* Inventory Sorter: There is now several main Ingestible categories: AID (Stimpak), ALCH (Whiskey), CHEM (Buffout), DRNK (Nuka-Cola), FOOD, MAG (Lad&#39;s Life), and TOX (Bleak Venom). The Misc Items categories are BOOK (skill books), CURR (Pre-War Money, Legion Denarius), CARD (Casino cards), RELO (Lead), MOD (weapons mods), QST (quest items) and PART (crafting components). The Inventory Sorter only works with NVSE, needs to be enabled in the FOOK NVSE menu and doesn&#39;t work with Project Nevada - use their one, instead&#33;<br />* Graphic Overhaul: alcohols, creatures, new icons, weapons, many textures were improved to be more beautiful. It also includes some fixes, such as removing the visible &#39;101&#39; on the back of the Vault 34 Security Armor and the Sierra Madre Security Armors under certain light conditions.<br />* New places: Toxic Cave, a balanced low-level dungeon near Primm. The Nevada Brake & Auto, south of McCarran. The Radiation King Shop, in Freeside. The Smuggler Cache, a place south of Westside.<br />* Night Vision: Enhance your vision with some headgears like the Power Helmets. To use this feature, equip the [Nightvision Switch] in your inventory or, if you have NVSE, just press N (for at least a second). The NVGs need some time to be fully loaded, and you can edit the duration of their batteries in the FOOK menus.<br /><br />FOOK NVSE Features<br />* Shortcuts to many features like the FOOK Menus (just press O or = for at least a second, as said above) and Night Vision (N) on some helmets.<br />* Melee Lock-On: Allows you to lock on to enemies via a hotkey (C) while you have an Unarmed or Melee weapon equipped.<br /><br />Dead Money<br />* Sierra Madre Martini: Will now work like any alcohol, including dehydration.<br />* Gold Bars: can now be moved around with the &#34;grab&#34; command when dropped.<br />* Elijah&#39;s Last Words/Elijah&#39;s Ramblings: Now provide bonuses to the Unarmed skill rather than the Melee Weapons skill (Veronica didn&#39;t even had Melee Weapons tagged).<br />* Junk Rounds: Added .22LR and 12.7mm to the crafting list. Also, instead of crafting normal rounds, you&#39;ll now craft &#34;Junk&#34; (JNK) rounds, doing less damage and more dangerous to your weapons. On the bright side, you need much less material now, and you can still craft any kind of ammunition at 45 Repair.<br />* Holographic Vendors: Will now sell the recipe to craft Fixer at the Vending Machines.<br />* Automatic Rifle: Rebalanced similarly to how others automatic weapons were rebalanced in the official 1.3 patch (Spread halved, Health doubled, AP cost reduced). It can now also be rarely found in the Mojave Wasteland.<br />* Bear Trap Fist: Rebalanced to be slightly weaker than a Power Fist but to have better Crits and Limb Damages than it.<br />* Holorifle: Will now have visible changes to its mesh as weapon mod kits are added to it.<br />* Knife Spear Clean: Fixed to really have clean Cosmic Knives on its mesh.<br />* Police Pistol: Made a Tier 1 weapon and can now be rarely found in the Mojave Wasteland. Mesh slightly improved, iron sights fixed and ground model added.<br />* Throwing Knife Spear: Rebalanced similarly to how the Throwing Spear was rebalanced in a recent official patch. Can now be used by NPCs.<br /><br />Honest Hearts<br />* Playable Tribal races.<br />* 37 new unique loading tips, since Honest Hearts didn&#39;t had a single one before. The topics are Zion Canyon, Mormons, Tribals, the state of Utah, John Browning, the .45 ACP Round and the M1911 Pistol, and finally Vault 22 and its legacy.<br />* Spore Carrier Sap: Can now also be found on dead Spore Carriers from the vanilla game and Old World Blues.<br />* Grunt: Damage bonuses reduced from 25% to 20%. Doesn&#39;t affect the Marksman Carbine and the All-American anymore, but now affects This Machine and the M1 Garand. Extended to work with Bayonets and American assault rifles, like the R91 Assault Rifle.<br />* Fixed a bug where traveling to Zion in February would take 10 months rather than the usual two weeks (I&#39;m not kidding).<br />* A Light Shining in Darkness: Now a standard Holdout Weapon, as it was intended by the developers.<br />* .45 Auto Pistol: Fixed the glowing iron sights dots. Made a Tier 3 weapon, as it was intended by the developers.<br />* Compliance Regulator: Now with iron sights.<br />* Fire Bomb: Now much more powerful (as much as an Incendiary Grenade) but will explode on impact. Aim well&#33; Also, enemies dieing from a Fire Bomb critical hit wont be reduced to plasma goo anymore.<br /><br />Old World Blues<br />* Playable Lobotomite race.<br />* Added 37 new loading screens unique to Old World Blues.<br />* Fixes all weapons so they use their 1st Person Textures when used in 1st Person.<br />* Fixes numerous bugs about Old World Blues entries overriding vanilla New Vegas entries, such as empty Ammo Boxes suddenly containing Energy Weapons ammunition.<br />* Battle Brew: Now works like Vodka (no Intelligence loss with the Whiskey Rose perk, no dehydration with the Communist perk).<br />* Atomic-Valence Tri-Radii-Oscillator: Doesn&#39;t flatten hairs when worn anymore. Now uses the Earrings node.<br />* Lobotomite Goggles: Now has NVG capacity.<br />* Hazmat Suit: The suit now comes with integrated gloves, and can&#39;t be separated from its helmet. The Night Vision effect can also be turned ON/OFF with the standard FOOK NVG hotkey.<br />* Valence Radii-Accentuator: Doesn&#39;t flatten hairs when worn anymore. Now uses the Earrings node.<br />* Christine&#39;s COS Silencer Rifle: Can now be modded with Sniper Rifle Carbon Fiber Parts.<br />* FIDO: Can now be modded like its non-unique counterpart. Magazine now holds 100 bullets instead of 50.<br />* K9000 Cyberdog Gun: Magazine now holds 100 bullets instead of 50.<br /><br />Lonesome Road<br />* Added 40 new loading screens unique to Lonesome Road.<br />* Riot Gear Helmet: Can&#39;t stack with other headgears anymore. The Night Vision effect has been changed to use the FOOK NVG system. The helmet now has a visible neck cover.<br />* Advanced Riot Gear Helmet: Can&#39;t stack with other headgears anymore. The Night Vision effect has been changed to use the FOOK NVG system. The helmet now has a visible neck cover.<br />* Elite Riot Gear Helmet: Can&#39;t stack with other headgears anymore. The Night Vision effect has been changed to use the FOOK NVG system. The helmet now has a visible neck cover.<br />* The Marked Men are now affected by the Fight the Power&#33; perk.<br />* Broad Daylight: Is now a level 12 perk with an Agility and Sneak requirement - since the FOOK NVGs made it useless, it seems fair to make it a mid-level perk.<br />* Certified Tech: Now properly adds 25% to the current Critical Chance against Robots instead of adding 0.25%.<br />* Marked: The DT bonus won&#39;t show up in the Pipboy anymore, but it will still be present when shot. Tooltip was also fixed to mention DT instead of DR.<br />* Robotics Expert: Is now a level 26 perk with a Perception and Science requirement. It was mainly to be more accessible for Old World Blues and to be selectable even when limited by the Logan&#39;s Loophole trait.<br />* Laser Detonator: Not a quest item anymore. Be careful not to lose it&#33;<br /><br />Gun Runners&#39; Arsenal<br />* Some of the Arsenal&#39;s Unique weapons have changed location - you either have to buy them from other vendors (Esther, Medicine Stick, Li&#39;l Devil, Two-Step Goodbye) or you must find them through exploration (Embrace of the Mantis King&#33;, MF Hyperbreeder Alpha, Nuka-Breaker, Paciencia, Sleepytyme). Happy hunting&#33;<br />* Around 80 fixes and improvements to the Meshes & Textures of the Arsenal&#39;s weapons.<br />* Added the 25mm Grenade APW, the 5.56mm Pistol, the Battle Rifle and the Katana to the various leveled lists (enemies, loot, vendors) of the Mojave Wasteland.<br />* Replaced the GRA vanilla weapons copies with their vanilla counterparts. For example, you can now upgrade the vanilla Assault Carbine with the GRA mods, and it will count for the GRA Challenges. The vanilla Fat Man can also shoot the new GRA Mini Nukes.<br />* Replaced the GRA vanilla item mods copies with their vanilla counterparts. For example, instead of using the GRA-only &#34;Assault Carb. Ext. Mags&#34; item mod, you will use the vanilla &#34;Assault Carbine Extended Magazines&#34; item mod.<br />* Fixed the GRA ammunition and mods being unleveled - for example, you&#39;ll only start to find the new GRA Mini Nukes at higher level now, instead of always being present. The new item mods will also seamlessly be integrated into the vanilla mod lists.<br />* Removed the annoying &#34;GRA&#34; tags from every entries (ammunition, recipes, weapons) besides the Challenges.<br />* Removed the &#34;Vigilant Recycler&#34; tag from the new Optimized energy ammunition, since it is not necessary for their identification.<br />* Removed the &#34;Mad Bomber&#34; tag from the new crafted Explosives, since it is not necessary for their identification.<br />* New item mod: Hunting Revolver Sniper Scope.<br />* New item mod: Ripper High-Speed Motor.<br />* Fixed the 20 Gauge and 12 Gauge Pulse Slugs not properly affecting all power-armored NPCs.<br />* Nuka-Grenade (GRA): Now renamed &#34;Nuka Quartz-Grenade&#34; to mark the difference with the FOOK Nuka-Grenade.<br /><br />Activators<br />* Ash & Goo Piles: Now scripted to disappear properly after four days.<br />* Shotgun Trap: Will now always grant you a shotgun when deactivated.<br />* Many previously silent radios (such as in the Lucky 38 suite) have been edited to listen to Radio New Vegas when activated.<br /><br />Ammunition<br />* Energy Weapons ammunition Weight reduced, now uses the same values as the JSawyer mod.<br />* Real rounds were given their real names (.45 Auto is now .45 ACP, .50MG is now .50BMG).<br />* Harmonized the name of all the ammunition to have a better global coherence and to avoid word-wrapping (&#34;12.7mm Round, Hollow Point&#34; is now &#34;12.7mm (Hollow Point)&#34;, for example).<br />* Harmonized the capacity of all the same kind of ammunition - for example, all 5mm rounds now properly have a DT modifier, all buckshot shells have a proper damage modifier, etc.<br />* 10mm, JHP (Hand Load): Has been replaced by the 10mm JSP round, with improved damage and a minor armor-piercing capability.<br />* 12 Gauge Shotgun Shells: Magnum and Slug rounds now have a higher chance of recovering a hull whenever fired off.<br />* 20 Gauge Shotgun Shells: Magnum and Slug rounds now have a higher chance of recovering a hull whenever fired off.<br />* BBs: Can now be crafted from and to Lead.<br /><br />Armors<br />* Around 70 new armors and headgear, including classics (Hardened T-51b Power Armor), cut content, uniques (Van Graff Heavy Armor) and variants of existing armors (Brotherhood of Steel Combat Armor). They are perfectly integrated and balanced to fit all playstyles.<br />* Rebalance of the Light, Medium and Heavy armors. Medium and Heavy will weight less and have some DR (more for the Heavy) with their DT to be better protections.<br />* All glasses now only take the &#34;Eyeglasses&#34; slot instead of both the &#34;Eyeglasses&#34; and &#34;Mask&#34; slots. It means you can now wear glasses with certain headgear you couldn&#39;t use before.<br />* All items that had no DT before now at least gives 1 DT, or 1 DR if they are too light to be of any protection. This is because NPCs can only repair apparel items that gives at least a little amount of protection. That way, every apparel item can be repaired by NPCs without impacting balance too much.<br />* Other items were overhauled for a better coherence - for example, before, some hats had DT were other did not. The Boomers outfits, which are just leather jackets, had 4 DT when the Kings Outfit had 0. This kind of incoherence has been fixed.<br />* Helmets are now divided into Light (normal), Medium (Combat Helmets, Riot Helmets), and Heavy (Metal Helmets), just like armors. They will usually match the category of their main armor set. You can&#39;t repair a Power Helmet with a Baseball Cap anymore, but most headgears were edited to have more health and to be easier to cross-repair (ex: using a Decanus Helmet to repair a Legionary Helmet wasn&#39;t possible before).<br />* Most faction armors were renamed to properly show their faction and to make armor sorting easier. For example, the &#34;Trooper Helmet&#34; is now the &#34;NCR Trooper Helmet&#34;, the &#34;Raider Blastmaster Armor&#34; is now the &#34;Fiend Blastmaster Armor&#34;, etc.<br />* Cass&#39; Hat: Has been made playable, and can be removed from her at will.<br />* Chinese Stealth Armor: Can now be found with a separated Chinese Stealth Helmet, which has NVG capacity.<br />* Dirty Pre-War Businesswear: Fixed it not having a proper female gray texture.<br />* Enclave Officer Outfit: Female &#34;disappearing arm&#34; bug fixed.<br />* Grimy Pre-War Businesswear: Fixed it using the same textures as the Dirty version.<br />* NCR Ranger Patrol Armor: &#34;Power Armor Stance&#34; bug fixed.<br />* Pimpboy 3 Billion : Female mesh added.<br />* Rebreather: Isn&#39;t a quest item anymore. Also, it now correctly gives DT instead of DR.<br />* T-45d Power Armor: Now use US Army decals instead of Brotherhood ones.<br />* Tortiseshell Glasses: Renamed &#34;Tortoiseshell Glasses&#34;. Slightly more common, they were ultra-rare before.<br />* Vault 34 Security Helmet: Fixed to look like the Fo3 Vault Security Helmets.<br />* Veronica&#39;s Hood: Has been made playable, and can be removed from her at will.<br /><br />Creatures<br />* Cazadors: Attack range value upped to be slightly less than the original 1.0 one, but more than the edited 1.4 one.<br />* ED-E: The un-upgraded version of ED-E was not flagged as a &#34;Flier&#34; creature, and thus was vulnerable to land mines and other ground hazards. The upgraded Energy Zap won&#39;t have an idle sound anymore, and will have the same projectile as the Pulse Gun/LAER rather than the one of the Alien Blaster.<br />* Feral Ghouls: Won&#39;t give Good Karma when killed anymore. NCR Trooper Ghouls and Vault Security Ghouls will now have DT because of their armor.<br />* Lakelurk: Will now drop more Lakelurk Meat.<br />* Legion Mongrels: Now run slightly faster, and have the &#34;Tough Dog&#34; ability (2DT, like Vicious Dogs).<br />* NCR Guard Dogs: They are now German Shepherd instead of Vicious Dogs.<br />* Nightkins: Their &#34;Nightkin Toughness&#34; ability now correctly gives them DT instead of DR.<br />* Sentry Bot: Unconscious animations fixed. Head slightly harder to shoot in VATS.<br />* Spore Plants: Can now drop Spore Plant Pods upon death.<br /><br />Dialogs:<br />* Fixed the three Kings guarding Freeside&#39;s north gate having silent dialogs.<br />* You can now properly give 500 caps to the Vegas Medical Clinic.<br />* Dazzle: You now properly require the Cherchez La Femme perk rather than the Black Widow one to have cheap sex as a woman.<br /><br />Faction Armors Overhaul<br />* Non-humanoid companions such as Rex, ED-E and Lily won&#39;t drop faction armors to the ground anymore.<br />* If you have a positive Reputation with a faction, you won&#39;t &#34;lose&#34; that reputation back to neutral when wearing their armors.<br />* No more annoying faction warning pop-ups that appears on changing the worn armor to a faction armor.<br />* Khans armors will now makes you friendly with the Fiends. Cut dialogs with Bert Gunnarsson, Cook-Cook, Driver Nephi and Violet are thus unlocked.<br />* Wearing a Brotherhood/Khans armor won&#39;t make you hostile with the NCR and vice-versa if you made the right in-game alliances.<br /><br />FormLists<br />* All the FormLists were updated to contain the proper items. For example, you won&#39;t be stolen your bedroll kit at the entrance of the Fort anymore. The various weapon perks will work with all the relevant weapons, you and your companions will be able to slip the proper Holdout weapons into Casinos, etc.<br /><br />Ingestibles<br />* Around 15 new food item, including Cheezy Poofs, Brahmin Cheese, Nuka-Cola Quantum and various military rations.<br />* Raw Meats: will now all have a Strength reducer modifier unless you have the Lead Belly perk or a Food Sanitizer. Lakelurk meat is not included due its fishy nature.<br />* Steaks: will now all be more nutritious than raw meat.<br />* Stews (and Noodles): will now all restore some dehydration.<br />* Food Sanitizer: Has been added back into the game. It&#39;ll slightly increase the quantity of HPs restored by food and will negate the reduced Agility/Strength/Endurance effects associated with some kinds of food items.<br />* Stimpak: Weight set to 0.25.<br />* Super Stimpak: Weight set to 0.5.<br />* Wasteland Omelet: Now have a damage bonus to make it closer to other high-level food items (Brahmin Wellington, Yao Guai Steak).<br /><br />Leveled Items<br />* Fixed the possibility of Hidden Valley Paladins spawning with a T-51b Power Armor and a T-45d Power Helmet.<br />* 9mm Round, +P: Will now be more common - it was missing from the leveled list of special ammunitions.<br />* Plasma Grenade: Fixed a bug where vendors would sell less grenades than intended.<br />* Pulse Grenade: Fixed a bug where vendors would sell less grenades than intended.<br /><br />Loading Screens<br />* Replaced many loading tips with more specific, more helpful New Vegas references. Text mentioning Fallout3 items and skills was mainly removed and replaced with New Vegas lore and gameplay. New Vegas perks take a much higher priority than old Fallout3 perks, especially the less useful ones.<br />* Many new screens were added with tidbits of information from the Fallout New Vegas: Prima Official Game Guide, the Van Buren project, J.E. Sawyer&#39;s Fallout RPG and The Vault wiki.<br />* Many new screens were added with information about the Brotherhood of Steel. They are only used in the Brotherhood bunkers.<br /><br />Misc Items<br />* New item: Vault Water Canteens. They behave like the Pre-Order Vault 13 Canteen (except that the &#34;you take a sip from your Canteen&#34; message happens only once) but are home-made by the FOOK team.<br />* A lot of items now use their own unique icons rather than the generic junk one.<br />* Fission Battery: Replaced many static Fission Batteries with actual items that you can loot. Left behind all the batteries that were obviously intended as power sources for nearby lamps, such as in Primm and in Goodsprings.<br />* Rocket Souvenir: Isn&#39;t a quest item anymore, so it can be sold, bought or discarded at will. It now has a Weight, and is also a crafting item.<br /><br />NPCs<br />* Bert Gunnarsson: Will now accept to heal you if you have a limb crippled or are hurt in any other way, rather than just checking your Health.<br />* Boone: Can&#39;t be stripped naked anymore (sorry ladies). He&#39;ll now always wear at least an unplayable version of the Merc Grunt Outfit.<br />* Cass: Now has the correct tagged Skills, according to her dialogs (Explosives, Guns, Unarmed). Before, she had Melee Weapons, Guns and Sneak.<br />* Dawes: Won&#39;t shoot you after you pay your way into the NCRCF when wearing a Powder Ganger outfit.<br />* Crimson Caravan Traders: Will now work like Traveling Merchants.<br />* Emily Ortal: Unlocked a dialog tree about her relationship with Benny.<br />* Isaac: Won&#39;t lock himself in his house anymore.<br />* Ranger Andy: Fixed him not talking to you when trying to teach you the Ranger Takedown if you had a too low Unarmed skill.<br />* Raul: will now let you repair items at the Lucky 38 if you bought the Workbench upgrade. Will now also be in a proper Sandbox mode while in the Lucky 38.<br />* Poindexter: Is now a Caravan player.<br />* Vulpes Inculta: Slight redesign to match his Collector&#39;s Edition card and the female Caesar&#39;s Legion Courier&#39;s ending slides.<br /><br />Object Effects<br />* Most hats and caps will now only give a Perception bonus if (and only if) the player is outdoor and if the hour is between 6 AM and 6 PM - it&#39;s supposed to help against the sun.<br />* You can now toggle the Object Effects in the FOOK Menu. For example, you can only enable the effects for unique armors, or only enable non-combat effects. Besides uniques, only low-level and/or faction armors have actual combat bonuses, as an incentive to not use only the usual Leather/Metal/Combat armor progression.<br /><br />Perk<br />* New perk: Communist. While using weapons of Chinese or Russian design, your shots are 20% more accurate and, regardless of ammunition used, you ignore an additional 4 points of a target&#39;s Damage Threshold. Vodka&#39;s dehydration is also ignored.<br />* Cherchez La Femme: Damage bonuses increased from 10% to 15% due to proportionally lower numbers of female characters in the game.<br />* Child at Heart: Perk unlocked&#33; Merchants underestimate your bargaining abilities because of your childish behavior and you will get better prices (-15%) from them. It will also unlock a handful of dialog options with children, and you may even have a chance to find the unique, lucky Barnabas Bear&#33;<br />* Cowboy: Damage bonuses reduced from 25% to 20%. Now also affects Throwing Hatchets (and variants).<br />* Demolition Expert: Now has only 2 ranks. Each rank grants +10% damage and +10% larger explosion radius.<br />* Hit the Deck: The DT bonus won&#39;t show up in the Pipboy anymore, but it will still be present when shot at.<br />* Lady Killer: Damage bonuses increased from 10% to 15% due to proportionally lower numbers of female characters in the game.<br />* Lead Belly: Now negates the Strength penalty from eating raw meat, but doesn&#39;t make the Food Sanitizer useless as it doesn&#39;t remove penalties associated to other kind of food.<br />* Meltdown: Now only triggers from plasma weapon kills.<br />* Ninja: Now properly adds 15% to the current Critical Chance instead of multiplying the current Critical Chance by 1.15. Set to require either Unarmed or Melee Weapon skill levels.<br />* Piercing Strike: Set to require either Unarmed or Melee Weapon skill levels.<br />* Plasma Spaz: Now also increases attack rate with plasma weapons by 20%.<br />* Pyromaniac: Now require the Energy Weapons skill instead of the Explosives one.<br />* Rad Absorption: Now decreases radiation 10x faster.<br />* Stonewall: The DT bonus won&#39;t show up in the Pipboy anymore, but it will still be present when shot at. DT bonus vs. Melee/Unarmed weapons increased from 5 to 10.<br />* Slayer: Now also increases attack rate with melee and unarmed weapons by 30% (previously only decreased their AP cost). Set to require either Unarmed or Melee Weapon skill levels.<br />* Super Slam: Set to require either Unarmed or Melee Weapon skill levels.<br />* Terrifying Presence: Enemies now also have -20% chances of hitting you with a Critical Hit.<br />* Unstoppable Force: Set to require either Unarmed or Melee Weapon skill levels.<br /><br />Quests<br />* I Fought the Law: The NCRCF&#39;s Alarm can now be stopped using the Warden&#39;s Terminal.<br />* My Kind of Town: Deputies will now show up when the NCR and Meyer routes are completed.<br /><br />Rebalance<br />* Several Faction Leaders and other named NPCs have been rebalanced - for example, Head Paladin Hardin of Hidden Valley was previously level 11, making him as bad as an unexperienced BoS Paladin. He&#39;s now a level 23 killer. Chief Hanlon was worse than a low-level Ranger, and so on.<br />* Created and edited a handful of classes to have a better NPC lineup, from untrained (Bandits/Thugs), to professionals (Caravan Guards/Gangers/Legionaries), to skilled (Casino Family, Great Khan, NCR Rangers), to very skilled (Centurions).<br />* Many NPCs that had a wrong class (ex: Paladin Ramos being of the Slaver class, some Legionaries having Vault Dwellers stats, and so on) have been fixed, so expect them to be a little tougher.<br />* 1st Recon soldiers (and former members) are now much, much better sharpshooters.<br />* Benny now have the stats of the family leader he&#39;s supposed to be.<br />* Brotherhood of Steel members were buffed with implants to represent their technological edge.<br />* The Boomers will now also use U.S. Army and paratroopers weapons like the Assault and Marksman Carbines alongside some Combat Armors.<br />* Caesar&#39;s Legion soldiers now have the proper levels and stats to represent their physical fitness and their experience.<br />* Casino Guards are now strong enough to represent their tribal upbringing.<br />* Great Khans are now all of the same strength, instead of the females being half as weak as the males (good one, Obsidian). They are roughly on par with Legionaries, with some advantages and drawbacks.<br />* Gun Runners Guards are not pitifully weak anymore.<br />* Fiends will now all have the skills to use their Energy Weapons and won&#39;t give Good Karma on death anymore. Special Fiend variants can appear, each buffed with a particular drug. For example, a Fiend Steadshooter can spawn instead of a Fiend rifleman, pumped full of Steady.<br />* Kings Gang Members are now a match for the various Thugs of Freeside.<br /><br />Recipes<br />* You can now use your Sneak skill at a Workbench to paint some Combat and Power Armors into other variants.<br />* Recipes needing raw meat will now require a Steak instead. That way, you&#39;re not locked out of crafting high-level recipes with mid-level meat.<br />* New craftable weapons: Acid-Blood Grenade, Auto Axe, Cryolator, Dart Gun, Deathclaw Gauntlet, Mantis Gauntlet, Nuka Quantum-Grenade, Railway Rifle, Rock-It Launcher, Shishkebab, Spiked Bat, Tribal BB Gun.<br />* New campfire recipes: Mac & Cheese & Cram, Mole Rat Wonder Meat, Strange Meat(with Cannibal perk), Strange Meat Pie (with Cannibal perk), Ultrajet (with proper recipe), Yao Guai Steak.<br />* New workbench recipe: Armored Vault Suit, Cherry Bomb, Hardened T-51b Power Armor, Nuka-Cola Quantum, Tin Can.<br /><br />Vendors<br />* Boulder City: Ike doesn&#39;t share the same vendor chest with Trudy (Goodsprings) anymore.<br />* Camp McCarran: A Far Go Trader has set up shop near the truck garage. The Far Go Traders are known for selling a great variety of outfits and rare armors.<br />* Camp McCarran: Sergeant Daniel Contreras has been fixed - he won&#39;t wear the armors he is sold anymore, he will properly reset his caps every three days, and he&#39;ll only sell his chems if you finished his delivery missions first.<br />* Cottonwood Cove: A Legion quartermaster, Armicustos Atellus, has settled in the Storage building. Since the Legion mostly relies on looting to equip their soldiers, he doesn&#39;t sell much and doesn&#39;t have much Caps, but he does have an interesting supply of Throwing weapons and Legion money.<br />* Freeside: Mick & Ralph&#39;s shop heavily fixed. Ralph will now properly sell the miscellaneous items around the store. Mick will now properly sell some nifty Fallout 3 weapons as well as case boxes. Both of their inventories will properly reset as any other vendors, and that does include Mick&#39;s secret storage.<br />* Hidden Valley: Knight Torres inventory fixed to reset like every other vendors.<br />* Mojave Outpost: A Van Graff Sales Representative has just opened a low-level Energy Weapons shop in the unoccupied Brahmin pen.<br />* Nellis AFB: The Boomers now sells much more Explosives.<br />* Primm: Johnson Nash now sells a few low-tier Energy Weapons.<br />* Silver Rush: Gloria Van Graff&#39;s inventory fixed to reset like every other vendors. Also, the LVLIs were fixed to properly give better weapons at later levels, and she can now also sell the weapons just in front of her.<br />* The Strip: Sarah will now sell the Armored Vault 13 Jumpsuit and a Vault 21 Water Canteen as unique items. She will also sell Vault 21 Cards.<br />* The Thorn: An awesome merchant specialized in melee/unarmed weapons, heavy armors and booze has just opened.<br /><br />Weapons<br />* Around 60 new weapons, including classics (Wattz Laser Pistol/Rifle), cut content, uniques (VT-191 &#34;Murdelizer&#34;) and variants of existing weapons (White Legs Storm-Drum). They are perfectly integrated and balanced to fit all playstyles.<br />* Most vanilla Guns and Energy Weapons were renamed to have either their official name (Glock 86 Plasma Pistol), a classic Fallout-inspired name (HK MP10 10mm SMG) or a guess using vanilla materials (AER12 Tri-Laser Rifle).<br />* Added iron sights to several Energy Weapons: Alien Blaster, Laser Pistol, Laser Rifle and all uniques and DLCs variants.<br />* Fixed companions weapons: Boone&#39;s Scoped Hunting Rifle (will now use proper Hunting Rifle sounds), Lily&#39;s Assault Carbine (now silenced). They will now use also special ammunition if given to them, but they will be consumed, unlike their unlimited base ammo. All of the companions&#39; weapons also have a mod (Cass&#39; Shotgun has a choke, for example).<br />* Recharger weapons (Pistol, Rifle, MF Hyperbreeder Alpha) can now be used by NPCs - they were previously thinking they were always out of ammo.<br />* Several weapons can now be crafted, like the Deathclaw Gauntlet, the Mantis Gauntlet and the Shishkebab.<br />* Several weapons are not quest items anymore and can be removed from the inventory, like the Codac R9000 Camera and Loyal&#39;s Detonator.<br />* There is now unique ejected shell casings meshes for all Guns calibers, such as .22LR, 9mm, .45 Auto, .308, and so on.<br />* Binoculars: Now have a much better zoom and an integrated Night Vision Effect.<br />* Euclid&#39;s C-Finder: Weight reduced to 2.<br />* Incendiary Grenade: Enemies dieing from a critical hit wont be reduced to plasma goo anymore.<br />* Plasma Rifle: Fixed the rifle using sounds from the Plasma Pistol.<br />* Thermic Lance: Now does Fire damages on crits and on VATS special attacks. Considered a Pyromaniac weapon.<br />* Trail Carbine: Vanilla cut mods added back.<br /><br />World<br />* 15 new map markers, including Fremont Street, the Great Khan Armory and the McCarran Supply Shack.<br />* Camp Forlorn Hope: Removed the annoying Bloatflies of the graveyard.<br />* Freeside: The Kings will now only bring you gifts every three days instead of every single time you enter the zone.<br />* Primm: The dead Sheriff and Courier will now disappear once the town has been cleaned out and given a new sheriff.<br /><br />===============<br />Requirements:<br />===============<br /><br />* Fallout: New Vegas 1.4.0.525<br />* Fallout Mod Manager (FOMM), http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/36901<br />* (Recommended Option) Fallout: New Vegas DLCs: Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, Lonesome Road, Gun Runners&#39; Arsenal<br />* (Recommended Option) New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE) v2 beta 12 or higher, http://nvse.silverlock.org<br />* (Recommended Option) The Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) 1.2, http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42507<br /><br />===============<br />Installation:<br />===============<br /><br />In addition to a required files and a couple of ESM and ESP files, FOOK-NV includes many &#34;loose files&#34;, which are mainly fixed meshes and texture replacements for vanilla armors, creatures, items and guns. The loose files are optional though recommended, because they enhance greatly the game.<br /><br />0. Check the mod page for the latest news, resources and hotfixes.<br />1. Download the latest versions of the Required Files and/or Optional Files. You&#39;ll need the following : &#34;FOOK v1-13 Required Files&#34;, &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34; and optionally the &#34;FOOK v1-13 Optional Files&#34;. Also any optional patch(s) that may apply to your game or load order (like compatibility patches).<br />2. Unzip all the files to a temporary location.<br />3. Examine and familiarize yourself with the contents of all the folders, then READ the ReadMes.<br /><br />There are two different options for Installing, Upgrading and Un-installing FOOK: the &#34;Automated Method Using Fallout Mod Manager&#34; and the &#34;Manual Method&#34;. Both options require FOMM and are detailed as follows:<br /><br />FOMM Auto Installation:<br /><br />Veteran FOMM Users:<br />Install/activate (in this order): &#34;FOOK v1-13 Required Files&#34;, &#34;FOOK v1-13 Optional Files&#34; (if used), &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34;, then any patch(s) you might need. If you don&#39;t have ALL the official DLCs (excepted Courier&#39;s Stash), be sure to remove both the &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esm&#34; and &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esp&#34; files from the &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34; folder before installing/activating. See below for Load Order recommendations and detailed instructions for upgrading and un-installing.<br /><br />Novice FOMM Users:<br />1. Relocate all unzipped folders to your mods folder. If you don&#39;t already have a mods folder, create one entitled &#34;New Vegas Mods&#34; (for example) and locate it in your Fallout: New Vegas Directory (Not Data Folder&#33;).<br />2. Do you have ALL the official DLCs? If &#34;Yes&#34;, proceed to &#34;Step 3&#34;. If &#34;No&#34;, open the &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34; folder and locate the two files: &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esm&#34; and &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esp&#34;. Delete both of these files. *Note that if you install the official DLCs in the future, you&#39;ll need these two files, so you will have to redownload/reinstall the &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34; archive.<br />3. Launch FOMM, click &#34;Package Manager&#34;.<br />4. Locate &#34;Add FOMod&#34;, scroll to &#34;Create From Folder&#34;, navigate to &#34;FOOK v1-13 Required Files&#34;, double-click it then click &#34;OK&#34;. Once added to the &#34;Package Manager&#34;, highlight it and click &#34;Activate&#34;.<br />5. Repeat &#34;Step 4&#34;, this time adding and activating &#34;FOOK v1-13 Optional Files&#34; (if used). IMPORTANT: when activating this second part (and all subsequent parts), an &#34;Upgrade?&#34; window will appear: &#34;A different version...(blah blah blah)...install the new FOMod normally&#34;. Click &#34;NO&#34; to this every time.<br />6. Repeat &#34;Step 4&#34; once again, this time adding and activating &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34;. If you&#39;re using a patch(s), install/activate them LAST, in the same manner.<br />7. Close the Package Manager. In FOMM be sure ALL the check boxes next to the files you&#39;ve just activated are &#34;ticked&#34;.<br />8. Arrange the Load Order (see below).<br /><br />Manual Installation:<br /><br />1. Copy ALL the contents of the unzipped folders to the Fallout New Vegas Data folder (Fallout New Vegas/Data). By default, this is usually: Program Files/Steam/Steamapps/Common/Fallout New Vegas/Data.<br />2. Launch Fallout Mod Manager and place a tickmark in the checkboxes beside the FOOK - New Vegas.esm and .esp file(s) and all other FOOK files/patches you may have installed.<br />3. Arrange the Load Order (see below).<br /><br />The Mod Configuration Menu / Darnified UI Installation:<br />If you are using The Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) 1.2 by Pelinor, or MCM and Darnified UI (DarnUI) v0.0.4 by Darn - pre-edited &#34;start_menu.xml&#34; files are provided for your convenience located in &#34;Fallout New Vegas/Data/Menus/Options/&#34;. Copy the XML file of your choosing, paste it in the same directory, and rename it to &#34;start_menu.xml&#34;.<br />- If you use MCM with FOOKNV, you would copy/paste/rename &#34;start_menu - VANILLA MCM.xml&#34; to &#34;start_menu.xml&#34;.<br />- If you use MCM and DarnUI with FOOKNV, you would copy/paste/rename &#34;start_menu - DARN MCM.xml&#34; to &#34;start_menu.xml&#34;.<br />For more instructions about how to install MCM and DarnUI, check their respective mod pages.<br /><br />===============<br />Load Order:<br />===============<br /><br />FalloutNV.esm must go first, &#34;FOOK - New Vegas.esm&#34; should go near the top of your load order. &#34;FOOK - New Vegas.esp&#34; should be the very last item of your load order to avoid conflicts.<br /><br />Standard Load Order WITHOUT the New Vegas DLCs:<br /><br />FalloutNV.esm<br />FOOK - New Vegas.esm<br />&lt;any other mod&gt;<br />FOOK - New Vegas.esp<br />&lt;any Patch(s) you may have installed&gt;<br /><br />Standard Load Order WITH the New Vegas DLCs. You need ALL the New Vegas DLCs (excepted Courier&#39;s Stash). As you can see, similar recommendations as above for &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esm&#34; and &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esp&#34;:<br /><br />FalloutNV.esm<br />DeadMoney.esm<br />HonestHearts.esm<br />OldWorldBlues.esm<br />LonesomeRoad.esm<br />GunRunnersArsenal.esm<br />FOOK - New Vegas.esm<br />FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esm<br />&lt;any other mod&gt;<br />FOOK - New Vegas.esp<br />FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esp<br />&lt;any Patch(s) you may have installed&gt;<br /><br />We don&#39;t plan to have separate files for people who only have one of the official DLCs. Note that Fallout Mod Manager is only required once, to create your load order. After that, you can launch the game as you want.<br /><br />===============<br />Upgrading:<br />===============<br /><br />FOMM Auto Upgrading:<br />0. Download the latest file(s)/patches(s) you wish to upgrade, unzip to a temporary location and examine/familiarize yourself with the contents of the folders.<br />1. Launch FOMM, click &#34;Package Manager&#34;.<br />2. Locate the mod file you wish to replace, highlight it and click &#34;Deactivate&#34;. Right-click on the mod file in the Package Manager and delete it. Repeat if there are more than one mod file to upgrade.<br />3. Open your &#34;New Vegas Mods&#34; folder, locate and delete the old version(s). Replace with the new. Close the folder.<br />4. Install/activate the new mod files as you normally would (refer to the &#34;Installation&#34; instructions above).<br />5. Double check your Load Order and rearrange if necessary (see &#34;Load Order&#34; above).<br /><br />Upgrading Manually:<br />0. Download the latest file(s)/patches(s) you wish to upgrade, unzip to a temporary location and examine/familiarize yourself with the contents of the folders.<br />1. &#34;Copy and replace&#34; ALL the contents of the unzipped folders you&#39;re Upgrading to the Fallout New Vegas Data folder (default location: Program Files/Steam/Steamapps/Common/Fallout New Vegas/Data).<br />2. Launch Fallout Mod Manager and place a tickmark in the checkboxes beside the mod files you&#39;ve just Upgraded.<br />3. Double check your Load Order and rearrange if necessary (see &#34;Load Order&#34; above).<br />4. After upgrading, launch your game and load your latest relevant save. Open the FOOK Menu in your inventory and &#34;Set all options to FOOK defaults&#34; then close (doing this may move the camera slightly apart. If this occurs, save, quit, then reload the save).<br /><br />IMPORTANT:<br />1. After upgrading, launch your game and load your latest relevant save. Open the FOOK Menu in your inventory and &#34;Set all options to FOOK defaults&#34; then close (doing this may move the camera slightly apart. If this occurs, save, quit, then reload the save).<br />2. Wait four days (of in-game time) in an unoccupied location to reset the cells and NPCs inventories. A player&#39;s house is a good place for this. Remember you can toggle off Hardcore Mode in the game options if you don&#39;t want to eat a lot of food and drink a lot of water during those four days.<br />3. Save your game and quit. This procedure is just to make sure your save is updated to work with the latest features.<br /><br />===============<br />Un-installation:<br />===============<br /><br />Note: Many required and all loose files are simply overrides for already existing resources included in vanilla New Vegas, and can be left as is or overridden without issue to fit user tastes.<br /><br />FOMM Auto Un-installation:<br />1. Launch FOMM, click &#34;Package Manager&#34;.<br />2. Locate the mod file(s) you wish to un-install, highlight and click &#34;Deactivate&#34;. Right-click on the mod file(s) in the Package Manager and delete.<br />3. Open your &#34;New Vegas Mods&#34; folder, locate and delete the mod file(s). Your Data Folder is now fully restored to it&#39;s original condition prior to downloading/installing FOOK.<br /><br />Manual Un-installation:<br />1. Launch FOMM. Untick all the FOOK .esm and .esp file(s) and any patch(s) (if any).<br />2. Delete by hand the files/folders associated with the mod from your Data Folder.<br /><br />IMPORTANT:<br />1. After uninstalling, launch your game and load your latest relevant save.<br />2. Wait four days (of in-game time) in an unoccupied location to reset the cells and NPCs inventories. A player&#39;s house is a good place for this. Remember you can toggle off Hardcore Mode in the game options if you don&#39;t want to eat a lot of food and drink a lot of water during those four days.<br />3. Save your game and quit. This procedure is just to make sure your save is updated to be completely FOOK-free.<br /><br />===============<br />Compatibility:<br />===============<br /><br />Any mods editing the vanilla ammunition, armors, leveled lists, NPCs and weapons will most probably conflict with FOOK-NV. Please remember that conflicts do not always mean bugs, it&#39;s just that some of the FOOK features will be overriden.<br /><br />FOOK-NV can override these changes by having the ESP file placed below the other mod in the load order. If you wish so, you can also just keep the FOOK features overriden, or even try to create a merged patch. For simple incompatibilities like armors and ingestible, it should work without problems.<br /><br />The FOOK Team is not responsible for any incompatibilities or bugs stemming from using non-compatible mods in your load order.<br /><br />===============<br />Recommended/Compatible Mods:<br />===============<br /><br />Recommended mods are always compatible with FOOK, but remember to check that all those mods and the corresponding compatibility patches are up-to-date.<br /><br />Recommended:<br />* New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE) v2b12 or better. Don&#39;t miss the cool NVSE features: http://nvse.silverlock.org/<br />* The Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) 1.2 by Pelinor. Configure all of your favorites mods in the same place: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42507<br />* WME - Weapon Mod Expansion. A massive expansion to the New Vegas weapon modification system, adding over 150 new modification options to the game. Made by Jonnyeah, a FOOK Team member: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/37576<br /><br />About Project Nevada:<br />* Remember that Project Nevada is split up into different modules.<br />* Project Nevada Core and Cyberware modules are compatible with FOOK (and any other mod).<br />* As for the Equipment module, there&#39;s a lot of overlap between the two, so just pick one or you will end up with a lot of duplicate weapons.<br />* Rebalance module should also be compatible with FOOK, since most settings can be set to &#39;Vanilla&#39; which will stop PN from changing the settings and other mods can alter them instead.<br /><br />Compatible:<br />* BIS - Brumbek&#39;s Inventory Sorting, by Brumbek. This mod renames every single item you can pick up to sort your inventory: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/38604<br />* Robert Fook Armor, by Nivea. This mod adds Robert male versions of all skin showing FOOK New Vegas armors: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42336<br />* FOOK n Breeze Armor Patch, by Keleigh3000. This mod adds Breeze male versions of all skin showing FOOK New Vegas armors: http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/50771<br /><br />Incompatible:<br />* Arwen&#39;s Camera Mod: The NVSE Camera Options in the FOOK menus makes this mod incompatible. You can emulate the mod by enabling the FOOK Camera Feature Options and using the arrow keys to adjust your camera close to Arwen&#39;s setting (NVSE required).<br />* Perk Every Level: You can emulate the mod by choosing another perk/level rate in the FOOK menus (NVSE required).<br />* Mods changing the weapons animations: You need to re-install those mods after installing FOOK.<br /><br />Outdated Mods:<br />* nVamp: The current nVamp version was made for FOOK-NV 0.70, which has gone a long way since. Don&#39;t use nVamp.<br /><br />===============<br />Bugs/Issues:<br />===============<br /><br />Please, remember to update keep up to date your Fallout: New Vegas game, your Fallout Mod Manager program, the New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE) and The Mod Configuration Menu (MCM). FOOK is always made to work with the latest tools and updates.<br /><br />If you use a mod that needs a Compatibility Patch to work with FOOK, make sure the patch is properly up-to-date to work with both new versions of your mod and of FOOK. Otherwise, problems will happen.<br /><br />Vanilla Bugs:<br />* A vendor doesn&#39;t refresh his inventory: Have you properly waited four days (of in-game time) in an unoccupied location, as described above? If yes, enter the vendor&#39;s shop and, without interacting with anyone, save and quit your game. Re-launch the game and then use the &#34;Continue&#34; option to load your save. The vendor should have refreshed. Mick & Ralph are both commonly having this bug.<br />* Some NPCs have a very pale face: You must open your (install folder)/Fallout New Vegas/Fallout_default.ini file and change the &#34;bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=0&#34; line to &#34;bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=1&#34;, and then open the Game Launcher to actually update the Fallout.ini that is in My Documents.<br />* Some NPCS are naked/have a weird inventory: An engine bug will sometimes not correctly refresh named and unnamed NPCs. Should you encounter this problem, just open the console (http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Gamebryo_console_commands), click on the npc and type &#34;resurrect&#34;. The NPC will be correctly refreshed with its new FOOK gear.<br />* NPCs talks with an echo and there is heavy outdoor lag: You must open the Fallout_default.ini file mentioned above and make sure that the &#34;bEnableEnviroEffectsOnPC&#34; line is set to zero, and then open the Game Launcher to actually update the Fallout.ini that is in My Documents.<br /><br />Incompatibilies with other mods:<br />* Some NPCs with rifles are shooting at their feet: If you&#39;re using a mod like New Vegas - Re-Animated and Ironsights Animation, you need to reinstall them after you&#39;ve installed FOOK.<br />* The Inventory Sorter doesn&#39;t work: Are you using Project Nevada ?

One HUD (oHUD) 1.1.0
====================================================
By Gopher for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[center][youtube]TtwRJv2cE-k[/youtube][youtube]E12a85M9_r0[/youtube][/center]<br />[color=cyan]What is oHUD?[/color]<br />One HUD (oHUD) is the final coming together of all my HUD mods. For those of you who enjoyed using all three, but wished they would just come in one handy mod, this is it. When you install this you get three mods listed in MCM: Immersive HUD, Adjustable HUD and Extra HUD (formerly know as Primary Needs HUD).<br /><br />1. The aim of Immersive HUD is to provide the immersive feel you get from having no HUD, whilst keeping the usefulness of having one. It takes the permanantly visible HUD elements such as HP, AP, radar etc, and hides them when not needed. Hence the motto: HUD when you need. HIDE when you don&#39;t.<br /><br />2. The aim of Adjustable HUD is to let you set up your HUD as you like it. Don&#39;t like the compass where it is? No problem. Just move it. Too many brackets? Get rid of some. And that is pretty much it.<br /><br />3. The aim of Extra HUD is to add a lot of other useful HUD elements including a clock, primary needs, encumbrance and more.<br /><br />NOTE: The DT it displays is the DT of your armor. The game has an unreliable system for reporting actual DT values and until I find a reliable answer, this number will basically tell you the condition of your armor.<br /><br />[color=cyan]So how does Immersive HUD work?[/color]<br />By default, your HUD will be blank after you load your game, and once the usual quest update messages fade away your screen will be clear and uncluttered. Great for those screenshots and immersive gameplay moments. But you need to see your HUD for some reason? No problem. Just press the &#39;i&#39; key, and your HUD will appear. Press it again, and it is gone.<br /><br />But that is not all. The Immersive HUD attempts to make even this task easier for you by automatically switching the HUD elements on and off as needed. For example the crosshair will appear when you draw your weapon. The HitPpoint area will appear when you drop below half health etc. <br /><br />And once they appear, do you have to make them go? Not at all. They will disapear after a short delay (6 seconds default).<br /><br />Now I realise not everyone has identical needs, and so Immersive HUD provides a host of custom options. This mod has a fully funtional MCM menu, allowing you to change every setting to your own personal needs. You can even change the activation key to another, or even a mouse button.<br /><br />[color=cyan]Requirements[/color]<br />This mod requires [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=42507]The Mod Configuration Menu (MCM)[/url] for full functionality.<br />This mod NEEDS NVSE&#33;<br />You almost certainly need to use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/57174]UIO - User Interface Organizer[/url] for this mod. It is possible to manually install HUD elements, but I do not support it.<br /><br />[color=cyan]Will it work with MTUI and Darnified UI?[/color]<br />YES, but for Darns UI it must be v4 (see the link in the supported UI/mods section) and you will need the optional Darnfied Patch.<br /><br />[color=cyan]What about HUD elements added by other mods?[/color]<br />I have tried to cover all that I could find, but contact me if you find a mod that you feel needs iHUDification.<br /><br />[color=cyan]Installation[/color]<br />1. Download and install with a mod manager (such as NMM)<br />2. When prompted to overwrite files ALWAYS CLICK YES&#33;-<br />3. If you are using the Darnified UI also download the Darnified Patch from the optional section under files.<br />4. If you have not already installed UIO, do so&#33;<br /><br />[color=cyan]Installation of HUD mods after One HUD is installed[/color]<br />If you install any of the supported mods below after One HUD please do NOT overwrite any of the oHUD files. If you do so by accident, just uninstall oHUD and reinstall it. It should fix any HUD elements that were not being hidden.<br /><br />[color=cyan]What mods work well with this one?[/color]<br />1. [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38808]Grenade Hotkey[/url]. <br />2. [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=40040]Project Nevada[/url].<br />3.

[url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34902]MTUI v 1[/url]<br />2. [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/index.php?/topic/1143482-wipzbeta-darnified-ui-nv]Darnified beta test v 4[/url]<br />3.

[url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38961]Unified HUD Project[/url]<br /><br /><br />[color=cyan]Recommended Installation Order[/color]<br />It is important to install One HUD after Darns UI and any mods the require iHUDification:<br /><br />1. Activate Darnified UI or any other UI overhaul mod such as MTUI.<br />2. Activate Project Nevada<br />3. Activate Mod Configuration Menu (MCM)<br />4. Activate all other HUD altering mods (see above list).<br />5. Activate One HUD (oHUD) *.<br /><br />[color=cyan]Troubleshooting[/color]<br />Problem : Missing compass (or other element)<br />Fix : Try going into the Adjustable HUD section of the Mod Configuration menu and resetting the position of that element. It should reappear.<br /><br />Problem : Cannot (or will not) use UIO.<br />Fix : No idea why you cannot use it but I am leaving the old version with the scripted installer in the old section of the files. Use that with NMM or FOMM and run [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/38961]Unified HUD[/url] afterwards.

Uranium Rounds 2.0.3
====================================================
By Jendo02 for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[b]Uranium Rounds – Weaponising Fission Batteries since 2281[/b]
<br />
<br />====================================================   
<br />   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿Warning:
<br />Versions &gt;= 2.0.2 may not be compatible with previous versions!
<br />
<br />From Version 2.0.2 the mod has been entirely rebuilt so old IDs 
<br />may no longer work.
<br />
<br />When upgrading make a note of the amount of each resource 
<br />you are carrying as you may need to manually add it back in.
<br />====================================================
<br />
<br />
<br />This mod allows you to disassemble Fission Batteries to acquire Uranium which can then be used as a Lead substitute to create Uranium Rounds. Uranium Rounds act similarly to Armour Piercing rounds but have a much higher Damage Threshold negation value of 25 vs 15 and a damage multiplier of 0.9x vs 0.95x. These attributes result in Uranium Rounds being suited for attacks against heavily armoured foes as with real life [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depleted_uranium]depleted Uranium[/url] rounds.
<br />
<br />Features:
<br />[list]
<br />[*]Breaking down Fission Batteries yields Uranium

FOOK v1-13 ESMs and ReadMes 1.13.0
====================================================
By The FOOK Team for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

Name: FOOK - New Vegas<br />Version: 1.13<br />Date: 16/03/2014<br />Category: Gameplay Effects and Changes<br />Requirements: Fallout: New Vegas 1.4.0.525, Fallout Mod Manager, Fallout: New Vegas DLCs (optional), NVSE v2b12 (optional), The Mod Configuration Menu 1.2 (optional)<br />Author(s): The FOOK Team<br />Source: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34684<br /><br />===============<br />Description:<br />===============<br /><br />FOOK - New Vegas is an overhaul for the Fallout: New Vegas game. FOOK is a coherent and balanced overhaul, adding and fully integrating many bug fixes, new items, high quality retextures and gameplay features to the base game. It also has full support for the Fallout: New Vegas DLCs.<br /><br />===============<br />Latest features:<br />===============<br /><br />So yeah, two years after the last update, here&#39;s a new one&#33; Hope you will enjoy it. Thanks to Jonnyeah, Drithius and blove for their help and support.<br /><br />You can find gameplay spoilers about FOOK in the FOOK_FullNotes.txt file, including where you can find the unique weapons and armors of the mod.<br /><br />Remember - don&#39;t use the &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs&#34; ESM file if you don&#39;t own Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, Lonesome Road AND the Gun Runners&#39; Arsenal. The Courier&#39;s Stash is not required.<br /><br />1.13 Changes<br />------------<br /><br />Dead Money<br />* Fixed Ghost people having a Perception of 0, the value will be 1 now.<br />* Fixed the Holorifle&#39;s maximal health being set to 101.5% instead of 150% by the Holorifle reinforced components mod.<br /><br />Lonesome Road<br />* Red Victory Grenade Rifle is not considered a Grunt perk weapon anymore, but is now considered a Communist perk weapon.<br /><br />Gun Runners&#39; Arsenal<br />* Fixed Sleepytyme missing from the Improved Holdout weapons list.<br /><br />Armors<br />* Fixed all variants of the Radiation Suit and Hazmat Suit having disembodied hands in 1st person view.<br />* Fixed several Metal Armor variants not having correct normal maps.<br /><br />Leveled Items<br />* Fixed the .45 ACP and Railway Spikes ammo lists. They were spawning with either the full amount of ammunitions or nothing.<br /><br />Recipes<br />* Fixed the BBs crafting recipes to be less exploitable.<br /><br />Weapons<br />* Updated the textures of the following weapons: Marksman Carbine, Makarov PM, .44 Magnum Revolver, Taurus Raging Bull, Grenade Launcher, Grenade Rifle, Combat Shotgun, 9mm Submachine Gun, Gauss Rifle, VSS Vintorez and their uniques counterparts.<br />* New mods added to the Makarov PM, the Taurus Raging Bull and the FN FAL.<br />* Fixed lack of 3D sounds for all variants of the Power Fist.<br />* Fixed the Cryolator to spawn more spaced gibs to avoid clipping.<br />* Slight nerf of the Fiend Roaster.<br />* Added a cut icon for the Golden Gloves.<br /><br />===============<br />Details:<br />===============<br /><br />FOOK Menus<br />* To open them, equip the [FOOK Menu Hotkey] in your inventory or, if you have NVSE, just press O (not zero, O, the letter&#33; Press it for at least a second).<br />* There is an option to activate (in Doc Mitchell&#39;s house) the FOOK QA Boxes containing all of the game&#39;s items. You can also just open them on the fly using the right options. If you have NVSE, just press = (for at least a second) to open the proper menu.<br />* If you have NVSE, you can edit the game to give yourself a perk at each level, allow or disallow Repair in Combat, and much more&#33;<br />* You can also remove your Pipboy glove, give yourself the Power Armor Training perk, access an infinite Bag of Holding, and more&#33;<br />* FOOK also support the &#34;Mod Configuration Menu&#34;, and all of the FOOK Menus have been mirrored in MCM for your convenience.<br /><br />FOOK Global Features<br />* Bug fixing: FOOK brings to New Vegas thousands of little fixes that can&#39;t be described because they would be too numerous - for example, NPCs having the wrong class, weapons not counting for their respective perks, etc.<br />* Improved Character Generation: You can now play a Raider or an Old character. Many new presets from Fo3 NPCs included, such as Colonel Autumn or Dad. Finally, added an unused female haircut (Cherry Taste) and fixed disappearing eyebrows.<br />* Improved crafting: FOOK brings back the interesting weapon crafting part of Fallout 3 with both new and old weapons. The hunt for schematics will test your wits and your sense of exploration&#33;<br />* Inventory Sorter: There is now several main Ingestible categories: AID (Stimpak), ALCH (Whiskey), CHEM (Buffout), DRNK (Nuka-Cola), FOOD, MAG (Lad&#39;s Life), and TOX (Bleak Venom). The Misc Items categories are BOOK (skill books), CURR (Pre-War Money, Legion Denarius), CARD (Casino cards), RELO (Lead), MOD (weapons mods), QST (quest items) and PART (crafting components). The Inventory Sorter only works with NVSE, needs to be enabled in the FOOK NVSE menu and doesn&#39;t work with Project Nevada - use their one, instead&#33;<br />* Graphic Overhaul: alcohols, creatures, new icons, weapons, many textures were improved to be more beautiful. It also includes some fixes, such as removing the visible &#39;101&#39; on the back of the Vault 34 Security Armor and the Sierra Madre Security Armors under certain light conditions.<br />* New places: Toxic Cave, a balanced low-level dungeon near Primm. The Nevada Brake & Auto, south of McCarran. The Radiation King Shop, in Freeside. The Smuggler Cache, a place south of Westside.<br />* Night Vision: Enhance your vision with some headgears like the Power Helmets. To use this feature, equip the [Nightvision Switch] in your inventory or, if you have NVSE, just press N (for at least a second). The NVGs need some time to be fully loaded, and you can edit the duration of their batteries in the FOOK menus.<br /><br />FOOK NVSE Features<br />* Shortcuts to many features like the FOOK Menus (just press O or = for at least a second, as said above) and Night Vision (N) on some helmets.<br />* Melee Lock-On: Allows you to lock on to enemies via a hotkey (C) while you have an Unarmed or Melee weapon equipped.<br /><br />Dead Money<br />* Sierra Madre Martini: Will now work like any alcohol, including dehydration.<br />* Gold Bars: can now be moved around with the &#34;grab&#34; command when dropped.<br />* Elijah&#39;s Last Words/Elijah&#39;s Ramblings: Now provide bonuses to the Unarmed skill rather than the Melee Weapons skill (Veronica didn&#39;t even had Melee Weapons tagged).<br />* Junk Rounds: Added .22LR and 12.7mm to the crafting list. Also, instead of crafting normal rounds, you&#39;ll now craft &#34;Junk&#34; (JNK) rounds, doing less damage and more dangerous to your weapons. On the bright side, you need much less material now, and you can still craft any kind of ammunition at 45 Repair.<br />* Holographic Vendors: Will now sell the recipe to craft Fixer at the Vending Machines.<br />* Automatic Rifle: Rebalanced similarly to how others automatic weapons were rebalanced in the official 1.3 patch (Spread halved, Health doubled, AP cost reduced). It can now also be rarely found in the Mojave Wasteland.<br />* Bear Trap Fist: Rebalanced to be slightly weaker than a Power Fist but to have better Crits and Limb Damages than it.<br />* Holorifle: Will now have visible changes to its mesh as weapon mod kits are added to it.<br />* Knife Spear Clean: Fixed to really have clean Cosmic Knives on its mesh.<br />* Police Pistol: Made a Tier 1 weapon and can now be rarely found in the Mojave Wasteland. Mesh slightly improved, iron sights fixed and ground model added.<br />* Throwing Knife Spear: Rebalanced similarly to how the Throwing Spear was rebalanced in a recent official patch. Can now be used by NPCs.<br /><br />Honest Hearts<br />* Playable Tribal races.<br />* 37 new unique loading tips, since Honest Hearts didn&#39;t had a single one before. The topics are Zion Canyon, Mormons, Tribals, the state of Utah, John Browning, the .45 ACP Round and the M1911 Pistol, and finally Vault 22 and its legacy.<br />* Spore Carrier Sap: Can now also be found on dead Spore Carriers from the vanilla game and Old World Blues.<br />* Grunt: Damage bonuses reduced from 25% to 20%. Doesn&#39;t affect the Marksman Carbine and the All-American anymore, but now affects This Machine and the M1 Garand. Extended to work with Bayonets and American assault rifles, like the R91 Assault Rifle.<br />* Fixed a bug where traveling to Zion in February would take 10 months rather than the usual two weeks (I&#39;m not kidding).<br />* A Light Shining in Darkness: Now a standard Holdout Weapon, as it was intended by the developers.<br />* .45 Auto Pistol: Fixed the glowing iron sights dots. Made a Tier 3 weapon, as it was intended by the developers.<br />* Compliance Regulator: Now with iron sights.<br />* Fire Bomb: Now much more powerful (as much as an Incendiary Grenade) but will explode on impact. Aim well&#33; Also, enemies dieing from a Fire Bomb critical hit wont be reduced to plasma goo anymore.<br /><br />Old World Blues<br />* Playable Lobotomite race.<br />* Added 37 new loading screens unique to Old World Blues.<br />* Fixes all weapons so they use their 1st Person Textures when used in 1st Person.<br />* Fixes numerous bugs about Old World Blues entries overriding vanilla New Vegas entries, such as empty Ammo Boxes suddenly containing Energy Weapons ammunition.<br />* Battle Brew: Now works like Vodka (no Intelligence loss with the Whiskey Rose perk, no dehydration with the Communist perk).<br />* Atomic-Valence Tri-Radii-Oscillator: Doesn&#39;t flatten hairs when worn anymore. Now uses the Earrings node.<br />* Lobotomite Goggles: Now has NVG capacity.<br />* Hazmat Suit: The suit now comes with integrated gloves, and can&#39;t be separated from its helmet. The Night Vision effect can also be turned ON/OFF with the standard FOOK NVG hotkey.<br />* Valence Radii-Accentuator: Doesn&#39;t flatten hairs when worn anymore. Now uses the Earrings node.<br />* Christine&#39;s COS Silencer Rifle: Can now be modded with Sniper Rifle Carbon Fiber Parts.<br />* FIDO: Can now be modded like its non-unique counterpart. Magazine now holds 100 bullets instead of 50.<br />* K9000 Cyberdog Gun: Magazine now holds 100 bullets instead of 50.<br /><br />Lonesome Road<br />* Added 40 new loading screens unique to Lonesome Road.<br />* Riot Gear Helmet: Can&#39;t stack with other headgears anymore. The Night Vision effect has been changed to use the FOOK NVG system. The helmet now has a visible neck cover.<br />* Advanced Riot Gear Helmet: Can&#39;t stack with other headgears anymore. The Night Vision effect has been changed to use the FOOK NVG system. The helmet now has a visible neck cover.<br />* Elite Riot Gear Helmet: Can&#39;t stack with other headgears anymore. The Night Vision effect has been changed to use the FOOK NVG system. The helmet now has a visible neck cover.<br />* The Marked Men are now affected by the Fight the Power&#33; perk.<br />* Broad Daylight: Is now a level 12 perk with an Agility and Sneak requirement - since the FOOK NVGs made it useless, it seems fair to make it a mid-level perk.<br />* Certified Tech: Now properly adds 25% to the current Critical Chance against Robots instead of adding 0.25%.<br />* Marked: The DT bonus won&#39;t show up in the Pipboy anymore, but it will still be present when shot. Tooltip was also fixed to mention DT instead of DR.<br />* Robotics Expert: Is now a level 26 perk with a Perception and Science requirement. It was mainly to be more accessible for Old World Blues and to be selectable even when limited by the Logan&#39;s Loophole trait.<br />* Laser Detonator: Not a quest item anymore. Be careful not to lose it&#33;<br /><br />Gun Runners&#39; Arsenal<br />* Some of the Arsenal&#39;s Unique weapons have changed location - you either have to buy them from other vendors (Esther, Medicine Stick, Li&#39;l Devil, Two-Step Goodbye) or you must find them through exploration (Embrace of the Mantis King&#33;, MF Hyperbreeder Alpha, Nuka-Breaker, Paciencia, Sleepytyme). Happy hunting&#33;<br />* Around 80 fixes and improvements to the Meshes & Textures of the Arsenal&#39;s weapons.<br />* Added the 25mm Grenade APW, the 5.56mm Pistol, the Battle Rifle and the Katana to the various leveled lists (enemies, loot, vendors) of the Mojave Wasteland.<br />* Replaced the GRA vanilla weapons copies with their vanilla counterparts. For example, you can now upgrade the vanilla Assault Carbine with the GRA mods, and it will count for the GRA Challenges. The vanilla Fat Man can also shoot the new GRA Mini Nukes.<br />* Replaced the GRA vanilla item mods copies with their vanilla counterparts. For example, instead of using the GRA-only &#34;Assault Carb. Ext. Mags&#34; item mod, you will use the vanilla &#34;Assault Carbine Extended Magazines&#34; item mod.<br />* Fixed the GRA ammunition and mods being unleveled - for example, you&#39;ll only start to find the new GRA Mini Nukes at higher level now, instead of always being present. The new item mods will also seamlessly be integrated into the vanilla mod lists.<br />* Removed the annoying &#34;GRA&#34; tags from every entries (ammunition, recipes, weapons) besides the Challenges.<br />* Removed the &#34;Vigilant Recycler&#34; tag from the new Optimized energy ammunition, since it is not necessary for their identification.<br />* Removed the &#34;Mad Bomber&#34; tag from the new crafted Explosives, since it is not necessary for their identification.<br />* New item mod: Hunting Revolver Sniper Scope.<br />* New item mod: Ripper High-Speed Motor.<br />* Fixed the 20 Gauge and 12 Gauge Pulse Slugs not properly affecting all power-armored NPCs.<br />* Nuka-Grenade (GRA): Now renamed &#34;Nuka Quartz-Grenade&#34; to mark the difference with the FOOK Nuka-Grenade.<br /><br />Activators<br />* Ash & Goo Piles: Now scripted to disappear properly after four days.<br />* Shotgun Trap: Will now always grant you a shotgun when deactivated.<br />* Many previously silent radios (such as in the Lucky 38 suite) have been edited to listen to Radio New Vegas when activated.<br /><br />Ammunition<br />* Energy Weapons ammunition Weight reduced, now uses the same values as the JSawyer mod.<br />* Real rounds were given their real names (.45 Auto is now .45 ACP, .50MG is now .50BMG).<br />* Harmonized the name of all the ammunition to have a better global coherence and to avoid word-wrapping (&#34;12.7mm Round, Hollow Point&#34; is now &#34;12.7mm (Hollow Point)&#34;, for example).<br />* Harmonized the capacity of all the same kind of ammunition - for example, all 5mm rounds now properly have a DT modifier, all buckshot shells have a proper damage modifier, etc.<br />* 10mm, JHP (Hand Load): Has been replaced by the 10mm JSP round, with improved damage and a minor armor-piercing capability.<br />* 12 Gauge Shotgun Shells: Magnum and Slug rounds now have a higher chance of recovering a hull whenever fired off.<br />* 20 Gauge Shotgun Shells: Magnum and Slug rounds now have a higher chance of recovering a hull whenever fired off.<br />* BBs: Can now be crafted from and to Lead.<br /><br />Armors<br />* Around 70 new armors and headgear, including classics (Hardened T-51b Power Armor), cut content, uniques (Van Graff Heavy Armor) and variants of existing armors (Brotherhood of Steel Combat Armor). They are perfectly integrated and balanced to fit all playstyles.<br />* Rebalance of the Light, Medium and Heavy armors. Medium and Heavy will weight less and have some DR (more for the Heavy) with their DT to be better protections.<br />* All glasses now only take the &#34;Eyeglasses&#34; slot instead of both the &#34;Eyeglasses&#34; and &#34;Mask&#34; slots. It means you can now wear glasses with certain headgear you couldn&#39;t use before.<br />* All items that had no DT before now at least gives 1 DT, or 1 DR if they are too light to be of any protection. This is because NPCs can only repair apparel items that gives at least a little amount of protection. That way, every apparel item can be repaired by NPCs without impacting balance too much.<br />* Other items were overhauled for a better coherence - for example, before, some hats had DT were other did not. The Boomers outfits, which are just leather jackets, had 4 DT when the Kings Outfit had 0. This kind of incoherence has been fixed.<br />* Helmets are now divided into Light (normal), Medium (Combat Helmets, Riot Helmets), and Heavy (Metal Helmets), just like armors. They will usually match the category of their main armor set. You can&#39;t repair a Power Helmet with a Baseball Cap anymore, but most headgears were edited to have more health and to be easier to cross-repair (ex: using a Decanus Helmet to repair a Legionary Helmet wasn&#39;t possible before).<br />* Most faction armors were renamed to properly show their faction and to make armor sorting easier. For example, the &#34;Trooper Helmet&#34; is now the &#34;NCR Trooper Helmet&#34;, the &#34;Raider Blastmaster Armor&#34; is now the &#34;Fiend Blastmaster Armor&#34;, etc.<br />* Cass&#39; Hat: Has been made playable, and can be removed from her at will.<br />* Chinese Stealth Armor: Can now be found with a separated Chinese Stealth Helmet, which has NVG capacity.<br />* Dirty Pre-War Businesswear: Fixed it not having a proper female gray texture.<br />* Enclave Officer Outfit: Female &#34;disappearing arm&#34; bug fixed.<br />* Grimy Pre-War Businesswear: Fixed it using the same textures as the Dirty version.<br />* NCR Ranger Patrol Armor: &#34;Power Armor Stance&#34; bug fixed.<br />* Pimpboy 3 Billion : Female mesh added.<br />* Rebreather: Isn&#39;t a quest item anymore. Also, it now correctly gives DT instead of DR.<br />* T-45d Power Armor: Now use US Army decals instead of Brotherhood ones.<br />* Tortiseshell Glasses: Renamed &#34;Tortoiseshell Glasses&#34;. Slightly more common, they were ultra-rare before.<br />* Vault 34 Security Helmet: Fixed to look like the Fo3 Vault Security Helmets.<br />* Veronica&#39;s Hood: Has been made playable, and can be removed from her at will.<br /><br />Creatures<br />* Cazadors: Attack range value upped to be slightly less than the original 1.0 one, but more than the edited 1.4 one.<br />* ED-E: The un-upgraded version of ED-E was not flagged as a &#34;Flier&#34; creature, and thus was vulnerable to land mines and other ground hazards. The upgraded Energy Zap won&#39;t have an idle sound anymore, and will have the same projectile as the Pulse Gun/LAER rather than the one of the Alien Blaster.<br />* Feral Ghouls: Won&#39;t give Good Karma when killed anymore. NCR Trooper Ghouls and Vault Security Ghouls will now have DT because of their armor.<br />* Lakelurk: Will now drop more Lakelurk Meat.<br />* Legion Mongrels: Now run slightly faster, and have the &#34;Tough Dog&#34; ability (2DT, like Vicious Dogs).<br />* NCR Guard Dogs: They are now German Shepherd instead of Vicious Dogs.<br />* Nightkins: Their &#34;Nightkin Toughness&#34; ability now correctly gives them DT instead of DR.<br />* Sentry Bot: Unconscious animations fixed. Head slightly harder to shoot in VATS.<br />* Spore Plants: Can now drop Spore Plant Pods upon death.<br /><br />Dialogs:<br />* Fixed the three Kings guarding Freeside&#39;s north gate having silent dialogs.<br />* You can now properly give 500 caps to the Vegas Medical Clinic.<br />* Dazzle: You now properly require the Cherchez La Femme perk rather than the Black Widow one to have cheap sex as a woman.<br /><br />Faction Armors Overhaul<br />* Non-humanoid companions such as Rex, ED-E and Lily won&#39;t drop faction armors to the ground anymore.<br />* If you have a positive Reputation with a faction, you won&#39;t &#34;lose&#34; that reputation back to neutral when wearing their armors.<br />* No more annoying faction warning pop-ups that appears on changing the worn armor to a faction armor.<br />* Khans armors will now makes you friendly with the Fiends. Cut dialogs with Bert Gunnarsson, Cook-Cook, Driver Nephi and Violet are thus unlocked.<br />* Wearing a Brotherhood/Khans armor won&#39;t make you hostile with the NCR and vice-versa if you made the right in-game alliances.<br /><br />FormLists<br />* All the FormLists were updated to contain the proper items. For example, you won&#39;t be stolen your bedroll kit at the entrance of the Fort anymore. The various weapon perks will work with all the relevant weapons, you and your companions will be able to slip the proper Holdout weapons into Casinos, etc.<br /><br />Ingestibles<br />* Around 15 new food item, including Cheezy Poofs, Brahmin Cheese, Nuka-Cola Quantum and various military rations.<br />* Raw Meats: will now all have a Strength reducer modifier unless you have the Lead Belly perk or a Food Sanitizer. Lakelurk meat is not included due its fishy nature.<br />* Steaks: will now all be more nutritious than raw meat.<br />* Stews (and Noodles): will now all restore some dehydration.<br />* Food Sanitizer: Has been added back into the game. It&#39;ll slightly increase the quantity of HPs restored by food and will negate the reduced Agility/Strength/Endurance effects associated with some kinds of food items.<br />* Stimpak: Weight set to 0.25.<br />* Super Stimpak: Weight set to 0.5.<br />* Wasteland Omelet: Now have a damage bonus to make it closer to other high-level food items (Brahmin Wellington, Yao Guai Steak).<br /><br />Leveled Items<br />* Fixed the possibility of Hidden Valley Paladins spawning with a T-51b Power Armor and a T-45d Power Helmet.<br />* 9mm Round, +P: Will now be more common - it was missing from the leveled list of special ammunitions.<br />* Plasma Grenade: Fixed a bug where vendors would sell less grenades than intended.<br />* Pulse Grenade: Fixed a bug where vendors would sell less grenades than intended.<br /><br />Loading Screens<br />* Replaced many loading tips with more specific, more helpful New Vegas references. Text mentioning Fallout3 items and skills was mainly removed and replaced with New Vegas lore and gameplay. New Vegas perks take a much higher priority than old Fallout3 perks, especially the less useful ones.<br />* Many new screens were added with tidbits of information from the Fallout New Vegas: Prima Official Game Guide, the Van Buren project, J.E. Sawyer&#39;s Fallout RPG and The Vault wiki.<br />* Many new screens were added with information about the Brotherhood of Steel. They are only used in the Brotherhood bunkers.<br /><br />Misc Items<br />* New item: Vault Water Canteens. They behave like the Pre-Order Vault 13 Canteen (except that the &#34;you take a sip from your Canteen&#34; message happens only once) but are home-made by the FOOK team.<br />* A lot of items now use their own unique icons rather than the generic junk one.<br />* Fission Battery: Replaced many static Fission Batteries with actual items that you can loot. Left behind all the batteries that were obviously intended as power sources for nearby lamps, such as in Primm and in Goodsprings.<br />* Rocket Souvenir: Isn&#39;t a quest item anymore, so it can be sold, bought or discarded at will. It now has a Weight, and is also a crafting item.<br /><br />NPCs<br />* Bert Gunnarsson: Will now accept to heal you if you have a limb crippled or are hurt in any other way, rather than just checking your Health.<br />* Boone: Can&#39;t be stripped naked anymore (sorry ladies). He&#39;ll now always wear at least an unplayable version of the Merc Grunt Outfit.<br />* Cass: Now has the correct tagged Skills, according to her dialogs (Explosives, Guns, Unarmed). Before, she had Melee Weapons, Guns and Sneak.<br />* Dawes: Won&#39;t shoot you after you pay your way into the NCRCF when wearing a Powder Ganger outfit.<br />* Crimson Caravan Traders: Will now work like Traveling Merchants.<br />* Emily Ortal: Unlocked a dialog tree about her relationship with Benny.<br />* Isaac: Won&#39;t lock himself in his house anymore.<br />* Ranger Andy: Fixed him not talking to you when trying to teach you the Ranger Takedown if you had a too low Unarmed skill.<br />* Raul: will now let you repair items at the Lucky 38 if you bought the Workbench upgrade.

For example, you can only enable the effects for unique armors, or only enable non-combat effects. Besides uniques, only low-level and/or faction armors have actual combat bonuses, as an incentive to not use only the usual Leather/Metal/Combat armor progression.<br /><br />Perk<br />* New perk: Communist. While using weapons of Chinese or Russian design, your shots are 20% more accurate and, regardless of ammunition used, you ignore an additional 4 points of a target&#39;s Damage Threshold. Vodka&#39;s dehydration is also ignored.<br />* Cherchez La Femme: Damage bonuses increased from 10% to 15% due to proportionally lower numbers of female characters in the game.<br />* Child at Heart: Perk unlocked&#33; Merchants underestimate your bargaining abilities because of your childish behavior and you will get better prices (-15%) from them. It will also unlock a handful of dialog options with children, and you may even have a chance to find the unique, lucky Barnabas Bear&#33;<br />* Cowboy: Damage bonuses reduced from 25% to 20%. Now also affects Throwing Hatchets (and variants).<br />* Demolition Expert: Now has only 2 ranks. Each rank grants +10% damage and +10% larger explosion radius.<br />* Hit the Deck: The DT bonus won&#39;t show up in the Pipboy anymore, but it will still be present when shot at.<br />* Lady Killer: Damage bonuses increased from 10% to 15% due to proportionally lower numbers of female characters in the game.<br />* Lead Belly: Now negates the Strength penalty from eating raw meat, but doesn&#39;t make the Food Sanitizer useless as it doesn&#39;t remove penalties associated to other kind of food.<br />* Meltdown: Now only triggers from plasma weapon kills.<br />* Ninja: Now properly adds 15% to the current Critical Chance instead of multiplying the current Critical Chance by 1.15. Set to require either Unarmed or Melee Weapon skill levels.<br />* Piercing Strike: Set to require either Unarmed or Melee Weapon skill levels.<br />* Plasma Spaz: Now also increases attack rate with plasma weapons by 20%.<br />* Pyromaniac: Now require the Energy Weapons skill instead of the Explosives one.<br />* Rad Absorption: Now decreases radiation 10x faster.<br />* Stonewall: The DT bonus won&#39;t show up in the Pipboy anymore, but it will still be present when shot at. DT bonus vs. Melee/Unarmed weapons increased from 5 to 10.<br />* Slayer: Now also increases attack rate with melee and unarmed weapons by 30% (previously only decreased their AP cost).

He&#39;s now a level 23 killer. Chief Hanlon was worse than a low-level Ranger, and so on.<br />* Created and edited a handful of classes to have a better NPC lineup, from untrained (Bandits/Thugs), to professionals (Caravan Guards/Gangers/Legionaries), to skilled (Casino Family, Great Khan, NCR Rangers), to very skilled (Centurions).<br />* Many NPCs that had a wrong class (ex: Paladin Ramos being of the Slaver class, some Legionaries having Vault Dwellers stats, and so on) have been fixed, so expect them to be a little tougher.<br />* 1st Recon soldiers (and former members) are now much, much better sharpshooters.<br />* Benny now have the stats of the family leader he&#39;s supposed to be.<br />* Brotherhood of Steel members were buffed with implants to represent their technological edge.<br />* The Boomers will now also use U.S. Army and paratroopers weapons like the Assault and Marksman Carbines alongside some Combat Armors.<br />* Caesar&#39;s Legion soldiers now have the proper levels and stats to represent their physical fitness and their experience.<br />* Casino Guards are now strong enough to represent their tribal upbringing.<br />* Great Khans are now all of the same strength, instead of the females being half as weak as the males (good one, Obsidian). They are roughly on par with Legionaries, with some advantages and drawbacks.<br />* Gun Runners Guards are not pitifully weak anymore.<br />* Fiends will now all have the skills to use their Energy Weapons and won&#39;t give Good Karma on death anymore. Special Fiend variants can appear, each buffed with a particular drug. For example, a Fiend Steadshooter can spawn instead of a Fiend rifleman, pumped full of Steady.<br />* Kings Gang Members are now a match for the various Thugs of Freeside.<br /><br />Recipes<br />* You can now use your Sneak skill at a Workbench to paint some Combat and Power Armors into other variants.<br />* Recipes needing raw meat will now require a Steak instead. That way, you&#39;re not locked out of crafting high-level recipes with mid-level meat.<br />* New craftable weapons: Acid-Blood Grenade, Auto Axe, Cryolator, Dart Gun, Deathclaw Gauntlet, Mantis Gauntlet, Nuka Quantum-Grenade, Railway Rifle, Rock-It Launcher, Shishkebab, Spiked Bat, Tribal BB Gun.<br />* New campfire recipes: Mac & Cheese & Cram, Mole Rat Wonder Meat, Strange Meat(with Cannibal perk), Strange Meat Pie (with Cannibal perk), Ultrajet (with proper recipe), Yao Guai Steak.<br />* New workbench recipe: Armored Vault Suit, Cherry Bomb, Hardened T-51b Power Armor, Nuka-Cola Quantum, Tin Can.<br /><br />Vendors<br />* Boulder City: Ike doesn&#39;t share the same vendor chest with Trudy (Goodsprings) anymore.<br />* Camp McCarran: A Far Go Trader has set up shop near the truck garage. The Far Go Traders are known for selling a great variety of outfits and rare armors.<br />* Camp McCarran: Sergeant Daniel Contreras has been fixed - he won&#39;t wear the armors he is sold anymore, he will properly reset his caps every three days, and he&#39;ll only sell his chems if you finished his delivery missions first.<br />* Cottonwood Cove: A Legion quartermaster, Armicustos Atellus, has settled in the Storage building. Since the Legion mostly relies on looting to equip their soldiers, he doesn&#39;t sell much and doesn&#39;t have much Caps, but he does have an interesting supply of Throwing weapons and Legion money.<br />* Freeside: Mick & Ralph&#39;s shop heavily fixed. Ralph will now properly sell the miscellaneous items around the store. Mick will now properly sell some nifty Fallout 3 weapons as well as case boxes. Both of their inventories will properly reset as any other vendors, and that does include Mick&#39;s secret storage.<br />* Hidden Valley: Knight Torres inventory fixed to reset like every other vendors.<br />* Mojave Outpost: A Van Graff Sales Representative has just opened a low-level Energy Weapons shop in the unoccupied Brahmin pen.<br />* Nellis AFB: The Boomers now sells much more Explosives.<br />* Primm: Johnson Nash now sells a few low-tier Energy Weapons.<br />* Silver Rush: Gloria Van Graff&#39;s inventory fixed to reset like every other vendors. Also, the LVLIs were fixed to properly give better weapons at later levels, and she can now also sell the weapons just in front of her.<br />* The Strip: Sarah will now sell the Armored Vault 13 Jumpsuit and a Vault 21 Water Canteen as unique items. She will also sell Vault 21 Cards.<br />* The Thorn: An awesome merchant specialized in melee/unarmed weapons, heavy armors and booze has just opened.<br /><br />Weapons<br />* Around 60 new weapons, including classics (Wattz Laser Pistol/Rifle), cut content, uniques (VT-191 &#34;Murdelizer&#34;) and variants of existing weapons (White Legs Storm-Drum). They are perfectly integrated and balanced to fit all playstyles.<br />* Most vanilla Guns and Energy Weapons were renamed to have either their official name (Glock 86 Plasma Pistol), a classic Fallout-inspired name (HK MP10 10mm SMG) or a guess using vanilla materials (AER12 Tri-Laser Rifle).<br />* Added iron sights to several Energy Weapons: Alien Blaster, Laser Pistol, Laser Rifle and all uniques and DLCs variants.<br />* Fixed companions weapons: Boone&#39;s Scoped Hunting Rifle (will now use proper Hunting Rifle sounds), Lily&#39;s Assault Carbine (now silenced). They will now use also special ammunition if given to them, but they will be consumed, unlike their unlimited base ammo. All of the companions&#39; weapons also have a mod (Cass&#39; Shotgun has a choke, for example).<br />* Recharger weapons (Pistol, Rifle, MF Hyperbreeder Alpha) can now be used by NPCs - they were previously thinking they were always out of ammo.<br />* Several weapons can now be crafted, like the Deathclaw Gauntlet, the Mantis Gauntlet and the Shishkebab.<br />* Several weapons are not quest items anymore and can be removed from the inventory, like the Codac R9000 Camera and Loyal&#39;s Detonator.<br />* There is now unique ejected shell casings meshes for all Guns calibers, such as .22LR, 9mm, .45 Auto, .308, and so on.<br />* Binoculars: Now have a much better zoom and an integrated Night Vision Effect.<br />* Euclid&#39;s C-Finder: Weight reduced to 2.<br />* Incendiary Grenade: Enemies dieing from a critical hit wont be reduced to plasma goo anymore.<br />* Plasma Rifle: Fixed the rifle using sounds from the Plasma Pistol.<br />* Thermic Lance: Now does Fire damages on crits and on VATS special attacks.

The loose files are optional though recommended, because they enhance greatly the game.<br /><br />0. Check the mod page for the latest news, resources and hotfixes.<br />1. Download the latest versions of the Required Files and/or Optional Files. You&#39;ll need the following : &#34;FOOK v1-13 Required Files&#34;, &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34; and optionally the &#34;FOOK v1-13 Optional Files&#34;. Also any optional patch(s) that may apply to your game or load order (like compatibility patches).<br />2. Unzip all the files to a temporary location.<br />3. Examine and familiarize yourself with the contents of all the folders, then READ the ReadMes.<br /><br />There are two different options for Installing, Upgrading and Un-installing FOOK: the &#34;Automated Method Using Fallout Mod Manager&#34; and the &#34;Manual Method&#34;. Both options require FOMM and are detailed as follows:<br /><br />FOMM Auto Installation:<br /><br />Veteran FOMM Users:<br />Install/activate (in this order): &#34;FOOK v1-13 Required Files&#34;, &#34;FOOK v1-13 Optional Files&#34; (if used), &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34;, then any patch(s) you might need. If you don&#39;t have ALL the official DLCs (excepted Courier&#39;s Stash), be sure to remove both the &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esm&#34; and &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esp&#34; files from the &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34; folder before installing/activating. See below for Load Order recommendations and detailed instructions for upgrading and un-installing.<br /><br />Novice FOMM Users:<br />1. Relocate all unzipped folders to your mods folder. If you don&#39;t already have a mods folder, create one entitled &#34;New Vegas Mods&#34; (for example) and locate it in your Fallout: New Vegas Directory (Not Data Folder&#33;).<br />2. Do you have ALL the official DLCs? If &#34;Yes&#34;, proceed to &#34;Step 3&#34;. If &#34;No&#34;, open the &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34; folder and locate the two files: &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esm&#34; and &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esp&#34;. Delete both of these files. *Note that if you install the official DLCs in the future, you&#39;ll need these two files, so you will have to redownload/reinstall the &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34; archive.<br />3. Launch FOMM, click &#34;Package Manager&#34;.<br />4. Locate &#34;Add FOMod&#34;, scroll to &#34;Create From Folder&#34;, navigate to &#34;FOOK v1-13 Required Files&#34;, double-click it then click &#34;OK&#34;. Once added to the &#34;Package Manager&#34;, highlight it and click &#34;Activate&#34;.<br />5. Repeat &#34;Step 4&#34;, this time adding and activating &#34;FOOK v1-13 Optional Files&#34; (if used). IMPORTANT: when activating this second part (and all subsequent parts), an &#34;Upgrade?&#34; window will appear: &#34;A different version...(blah blah blah)...install the new FOMod normally&#34;. Click &#34;NO&#34; to this every time.<br />6. Repeat &#34;Step 4&#34; once again, this time adding and activating &#34;FOOK v1-13 ESM and ReadMes&#34;. If you&#39;re using a patch(s), install/activate them LAST, in the same manner.<br />7. Close the Package Manager. In FOMM be sure ALL the check boxes next to the files you&#39;ve just activated are &#34;ticked&#34;.<br />8. Arrange the Load Order (see below).<br /><br />Manual Installation:<br /><br />1. Copy ALL the contents of the unzipped folders to the Fallout New Vegas Data folder (Fallout New Vegas/Data). By default, this is usually: Program Files/Steam/Steamapps/Common/Fallout New Vegas/Data.<br />2. Launch Fallout Mod Manager and place a tickmark in the checkboxes beside the FOOK - New Vegas.esm and .esp file(s) and all other FOOK files/patches you may have installed.<br />3. Arrange the Load Order (see below).<br /><br />The Mod Configuration Menu / Darnified UI Installation:<br />If you are using The Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) 1.2 by Pelinor, or MCM and Darnified UI (DarnUI) v0.0.4 by Darn - pre-edited &#34;start_menu.xml&#34; files are provided for your convenience located in &#34;Fallout New Vegas/Data/Menus/Options/&#34;. Copy the XML file of your choosing, paste it in the same directory, and rename it to &#34;start_menu.xml&#34;.<br />- If you use MCM with FOOKNV, you would copy/paste/rename &#34;start_menu - VANILLA MCM.xml&#34; to &#34;start_menu.xml&#34;.<br />- If you use MCM and DarnUI with FOOKNV, you would copy/paste/rename &#34;start_menu - DARN MCM.xml&#34; to &#34;start_menu.xml&#34;.<br />For more instructions about how to install MCM and DarnUI, check their respective mod pages.<br /><br />===============<br />Load Order:<br />===============<br /><br />FalloutNV.esm must go first, &#34;FOOK - New Vegas.esm&#34; should go near the top of your load order. &#34;FOOK - New Vegas.esp&#34; should be the very last item of your load order to avoid conflicts.<br /><br />Standard Load Order WITHOUT the New Vegas DLCs:<br /><br />FalloutNV.esm<br />FOOK - New Vegas.esm<br />&lt;any other mod&gt;<br />FOOK - New Vegas.esp<br />&lt;any Patch(s) you may have installed&gt;<br /><br />Standard Load Order WITH the New Vegas DLCs. You need ALL the New Vegas DLCs (excepted Courier&#39;s Stash). As you can see, similar recommendations as above for &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esm&#34; and &#34;FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esp&#34;:<br /><br />FalloutNV.esm<br />DeadMoney.esm<br />HonestHearts.esm<br />OldWorldBlues.esm<br />LonesomeRoad.esm<br />GunRunnersArsenal.esm<br />FOOK - New Vegas.esm<br />FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esm<br />&lt;any other mod&gt;<br />FOOK - New Vegas.esp<br />FOOK - New Vegas DLCs.esp<br />&lt;any Patch(s) you may have installed&gt;<br /><br />We don&#39;t plan to have separate files for people who only have one of the official DLCs. Note that Fallout Mod Manager is only required once, to create your load order. After that, you can launch the game as you want.<br /><br />===============<br />Upgrading:<br />===============<br /><br />FOMM Auto Upgrading:<br />0. Download the latest file(s)/patches(s) you wish to upgrade, unzip to a temporary location and examine/familiarize yourself with the contents of the folders.<br />1. Launch FOMM, click &#34;Package Manager&#34;.<br />2. Locate the mod file you wish to replace, highlight it and click &#34;Deactivate&#34;. Right-click on the mod file in the Package Manager and delete it. Repeat if there are more than one mod file to upgrade.<br />3. Open your &#34;New Vegas Mods&#34; folder, locate and delete the old version(s). Replace with the new. Close the folder.<br />4. Install/activate the new mod files as you normally would (refer to the &#34;Installation&#34; instructions above).<br />5. Double check your Load Order and rearrange if necessary (see &#34;Load Order&#34; above).<br /><br />Upgrading Manually:<br />0. Download the latest file(s)/patches(s) you wish to upgrade, unzip to a temporary location and examine/familiarize yourself with the contents of the folders.<br />1. &#34;Copy and replace&#34; ALL the contents of the unzipped folders you&#39;re Upgrading to the Fallout New Vegas Data folder (default location: Program Files/Steam/Steamapps/Common/Fallout New Vegas/Data).<br />2. Launch Fallout Mod Manager and place a tickmark in the checkboxes beside the mod files you&#39;ve just Upgraded.<br />3. Double check your Load Order and rearrange if necessary (see &#34;Load Order&#34; above).<br />4. After upgrading, launch your game and load your latest relevant save. Open the FOOK Menu in your inventory and &#34;Set all options to FOOK defaults&#34; then close (doing this may move the camera slightly apart. If this occurs, save, quit, then reload the save).<br /><br />IMPORTANT:<br />1. After upgrading, launch your game and load your latest relevant save. Open the FOOK Menu in your inventory and &#34;Set all options to FOOK defaults&#34; then close (doing this may move the camera slightly apart. If this occurs, save, quit, then reload the save).<br />2. Wait four days (of in-game time) in an unoccupied location to reset the cells and NPCs inventories. A player&#39;s house is a good place for this. Remember you can toggle off Hardcore Mode in the game options if you don&#39;t want to eat a lot of food and drink a lot of water during those four days.<br />3. Save your game and quit. This procedure is just to make sure your save is updated to work with the latest features.<br /><br />===============<br />Un-installation:<br />===============<br /><br />Note: Many required and all loose files are simply overrides for already existing resources included in vanilla New Vegas, and can be left as is or overridden without issue to fit user tastes.<br /><br />FOMM Auto Un-installation:<br />1. Launch FOMM, click &#34;Package Manager&#34;.<br />2. Locate the mod file(s) you wish to un-install, highlight and click &#34;Deactivate&#34;. Right-click on the mod file(s) in the Package Manager and delete.<br />3. Open your &#34;New Vegas Mods&#34; folder, locate and delete the mod file(s). Your Data Folder is now fully restored to it&#39;s original condition prior to downloading/installing FOOK.<br /><br />Manual Un-installation:<br />1. Launch FOMM. Untick all the FOOK .esm and .esp file(s) and any patch(s) (if any).<br />2. Delete by hand the files/folders associated with the mod from your Data Folder.<br /><br />IMPORTANT:<br />1. After uninstalling, launch your game and load your latest relevant save.<br />2. Wait four days (of in-game time) in an unoccupied location to reset the cells and NPCs inventories. A player&#39;s house is a good place for this. Remember you can toggle off Hardcore Mode in the game options if you don&#39;t want to eat a lot of food and drink a lot of water during those four days.<br />3. Save your game and quit. This procedure is just to make sure your save is updated to be completely FOOK-free.<br /><br />===============<br />Compatibility:<br />===============<br /><br />Any mods editing the vanilla ammunition, armors, leveled lists, NPCs and weapons will most probably conflict with FOOK-NV. Please remember that conflicts do not always mean bugs, it&#39;s just that some of the FOOK features will be overriden.<br /><br />FOOK-NV can override these changes by having the ESP file placed below the other mod in the load order. If you wish so, you can also just keep the FOOK features overriden, or even try to create a merged patch. For simple incompatibilities like armors and ingestible, it should work without problems.<br /><br />The FOOK Team is not responsible for any incompatibilities or bugs stemming from using non-compatible mods in your load order.<br /><br />===============<br />Recommended/Compatible Mods:<br />===============<br /><br />Recommended mods are always compatible with FOOK, but remember to check that all those mods and the corresponding compatibility patches are up-to-date.<br /><br />Recommended:<br />* New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE) v2b12 or better. Don&#39;t miss the cool NVSE features: http://nvse.silverlock.org/<br />* The Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) 1.2 by Pelinor. Configure all of your favorites mods in the same place: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42507<br />* WME - Weapon Mod Expansion. A massive expansion to the New Vegas weapon modification system, adding over 150 new modification options to the game. Made by Jonnyeah, a FOOK Team member: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/37576<br /><br />About Project Nevada:<br />* Remember that Project Nevada is split up into different modules.<br />* Project Nevada Core and Cyberware modules are compatible with FOOK (and any other mod).<br />* As for the Equipment module, there&#39;s a lot of overlap between the two, so just pick one or you will end up with a lot of duplicate weapons.<br />* Rebalance module should also be compatible with FOOK, since most settings can be set to &#39;Vanilla&#39; which will stop PN from changing the settings and other mods can alter them instead.<br /><br />Compatible:<br />* BIS - Brumbek&#39;s Inventory Sorting, by Brumbek. This mod renames every single item you can pick up to sort your inventory: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/38604<br />* Robert Fook Armor, by Nivea. This mod adds Robert male versions of all skin showing FOOK New Vegas armors: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42336<br />* FOOK n Breeze Armor Patch, by Keleigh3000. This mod adds Breeze male versions of all skin showing FOOK New Vegas armors: http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/50771<br /><br />Incompatible:<br />* Arwen&#39;s Camera Mod: The NVSE Camera Options in the FOOK menus makes this mod incompatible. You can emulate the mod by enabling the FOOK Camera Feature Options and using the arrow keys to adjust your camera close to Arwen&#39;s setting (NVSE required).<br />* Perk Every Level: You can emulate the mod by choosing another perk/level rate in the FOOK menus (NVSE required).<br />* Mods changing the weapons animations: You need to re-install those mods after installing FOOK.<br /><br />Outdated Mods:<br />* nVamp: The current nVamp version was made for FOOK-NV 0.70, which has gone a long way since. Don&#39;t use nVamp.<br /><br />===============<br />Bugs/Issues:<br />===============<br /><br />Please, remember to update keep up to date your Fallout: New Vegas game, your Fallout Mod Manager program, the New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE) and The Mod Configuration Menu (MCM). FOOK is always made to work with the latest tools and updates.<br /><br />If you use a mod that needs a Compatibility Patch to work with FOOK, make sure the patch is properly up-to-date to work with both new versions of your mod and of FOOK. Otherwise, problems will happen.<br /><br />Vanilla Bugs:<br />* A vendor doesn&#39;t refresh his inventory: Have you properly waited four days (of in-game time) in an unoccupied location, as described above? If yes, enter the vendor&#39;s shop and, without interacting with anyone, save and quit your game. Re-launch the game and then use the &#34;Continue&#34; option to load your save. The vendor should have refreshed. Mick & Ralph are both commonly having this bug.<br />* Some NPCs have a very pale face: You must open your (install folder)/Fallout New Vegas/Fallout_default.ini file and change the &#34;bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=0&#34; line to &#34;bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=1&#34;, and then open the Game Launcher to actually update the Fallout.ini that is in My Documents.<br />* Some NPCS are naked/have a weird inventory: An engine bug will sometimes not correctly refresh named and unnamed NPCs. Should you encounter this problem, just open the console (http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Gamebryo_console_commands), click on the npc and type &#34;resurrect&#34;. The NPC will be correctly refreshed with its new FOOK gear.<br />* NPCs talks with an echo and there is heavy outdoor lag: You must open the Fallout_default.ini file mentioned above and make sure that the &#34;bEnableEnviroEffectsOnPC&#34; line is set to zero, and then open the Game Launcher to actually update the Fallout.ini that is in My Documents.<br /><br />Incompatibilies with other mods:<br />* Some NPCs with rifles are shooting at their feet: If you&#39;re using a mod like New Vegas - Re-Animated and Ironsights Animation, you need to reinstall them after you&#39;ve installed FOOK.<br />* The Inventory Sorter doesn&#39;t work: Are you using Project Nevada ? If yes, use their own Inventory Sorter, as the one in FOOK is disabled when detecting Project Nevada.<br /><br />No other known issues so far, please let us know if you find any.<br /><br />===============<br />History:<br />===============<br /><br />1.13, 16/03/2014 - Updated textures for some weapons and a handful of fixes.<br />1.12, 11/02/2012 - Handful of fixes for a crash-on-exit issue and faction armors.<br />1.11, 09/11/2012 - Small tweaks to the mod that doesn&#39;t come with updated Data or Loose Files.<br />1.10, 03/10/2012 - Adding support for the JSawyer mod, handful of new weapons, lot of bugs fixes.

Fallout_New_Vegas_Interface_Mod_Revelation60 0.60.0
====================================================
By SGHi for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

Name: Fallout New Vegas Interface Mod - Revelation (~Classic Fallout UI)
<br />Version: 0.61
<br />Category: UI
<br />Required: Fallout New Vegas
<br />Author: SGHi
<br />
<br />
<br />[color=#FF6600][b]Description[/b][/color]
<br />This mod changes skin of ingame interface using textures from "Fallout Tactics" game. Also the number of text lines was changed in certain places.
<br />
<br />Following menus were changed:
<br />[list]
<br />[*]Barter
<br />[*]Container
<br />[*]Dialog
<br />[*]Quantity
<br />[*]Repair Services
<br />[*]Sleep Wait
<br />[*]Message menu
<br />[*]Tutorial menu
<br />[*]Reloading Bench
<br />[*]Workbench
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />[color=#FF6600][b]2010, Features[/b][/color]
<br />[list=1]
<br />[*]New buttons in certain menus.
<br />[*]5 big "menus" are now partially transparent(for 70%)
<br />[*]8 text lines in "Dialog menu" (3 usually)
<br />[*]18 text lines in "Repair Services menu" (14 usually).
<br />[*]11 text lines in "Barter/Container menu/Reloading Bench/Workbench" (7 usually)
<br />[*]Interface customization in Pip-Boy colors is now partially supported :)
<br />[*]New scrollbars in Barter, Container, Recipe, Repair Services and Dialog menus.
<br />[*]New pointers in Barter and Container menus.
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />Also this mod replaces default font with smaller and decreases line-spacing a little.
<br />
<br />
<br />[color=#FF0000][b][color=#00ff00]2018,[/color] [/b][/color][color=#FF0000][b]STANDALONE MOD VERSION BY AXONIS[/b][/color][color=#FF6600][b] - VANILLA UI PLUS REVELATION (NEW VEGAS)[/b][/color]
<br />Standalone version of my 0.60 mod with a lot of bugfixes and additional features. All props to [url=http://www.moddb.com/mods/vanilla-ui-plus]Axonis[/url]!
<br />
<br />Please install this version [color=#ff0000]or [/color]the original version, not both at once. Also, do not use patches from the original version on the standalone version. Also it [color=#ff0000]should be[/color] installed only with a mod manager such as NMM or FOMM.
<br />
<br />[color=#99CC00][b]Aside from merging all VUI+ features into Revelation, Standalone mod version by Axonis - "Vanilla UI Plus Revelation" - provide the following extras:[/b][/color]
<br />[list=1]
<br />[*]By preloading textures for the Container, Quantity, Barter, Recipe and Sleep/Wait menus, it allows them to be opened much faster.
<br />[*]It modifies the formatting and textures of the Tutorial and Crafting menus to properly fuse both Revelation and VUI+ takes on those menus.
<br />[*]You can use the mouse pointer to target a button in its entire width, not just the text. A few pixels are added to the buttons height to fit descender letters and the button text follows pressure movement.
<br />[*]All text is set to use standard colors, adjustable at the game settings. This might annoy a few users, but the ability of changing text color is too important for some players eyes.
<br />[*]All text displayed on metal, such as buttons and headings, is slightly outlined and shadowed to appear embossed.
<br />[*]All list elements are resized to perfectly fit into their list frames and scrollbars are perfectly docked as well. A few scrollbars that were left with the vanilla style have been set to the Revelation scrollbar style as well.
<br />[*]By applying the same code for both FO3 and NV versions, it updates the FO3 version to the latest Revelation developments for NV. 
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />[color=#99CC00][b]2010, Compatible mods[/b][/color]
<br />[list=1]
<br />[*]MTUI 1.0 (PipBoy &amp; main menu changes only) -&gt; install the MTUI, then install Revelation and just give it permission to overwrite all MTUI files!
<br />[*]PipWare UI New Vegas Edition 1.2c (PipBoy changes only) -&gt; install the PipWare UI, then install Revelation and just give it permission to overwrite all PipWare UI files!
<br />[*]MTUI 1.0 [color=#FF6600][b]+[/b][/color] PipWare UI New Vegas Edition 1.2c [color=#FF6600][b]=[/b][/color] (main menu changes from MTUI + PipBoy changes from PipWare UI) -&gt; install the MTUI, find and delete "fallout new vegas&#92;Data&#92;Menus&#92;[color=#FF6600][i]loading_menu.xml[/i][/color]" and "fallout new vegas&#92;Data&#92;Menus&#92;main&#92;[color=#FF6600][i]map_menu.xml[/i][/color]", then install PipWare UI with overwrite, then install Revelation and just give it permission to overwrite all files!
<br />[*]AsukaHUD 1 with any combination of the above -&gt; for example - install the AsukaHUD, then install PipWare, then install Revelation and just give it permission to overwrite all files!
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />
<br />[color=#FF6600][b]2010, WARNING![/b][/color][color=#FF0000][b] :)[/b][/color]
<br />[color=#99CC00]NOTE: Now you can use a fix or 2018 standalone version.[/color]
<br />
<br />Little [b]DELAYS[/b] when entering menus (i.e. barter) [color=#FF0000][b]MAY appear[/b][/color] because of new textures. Standard menus have very simple structure and light-weight textures. And when game loads my full-featured textures in real-time without caching... delay happens.
<br />
<br />And about buttons. Buttons was made with stock, bigger than text on them. Active area, which presses the button, is the same as text width. So pressing the button means pressing the text, not the borders of button. Later i'll try to fix the problem, but now it's low priority problem.
<br />
<br />
<br />[color=#FF6600][b]2010, Install[/b][/color]
<br />[list=1]
<br />[*]Backup your ingame menus, if a folder exists - Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;fallout new vegas&#92;Data&#92;*menus*!
<br />[*]Extract this archive to your Fallout Data folder. The Data folder can be found under the directory where you installed Fallout.
<br />[*]Start the game.
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />
<br />[color=#FF6600][b]2010, Uninstall[/b][/color]
<br />If you didn't install other GUI changing mods, all you need is to remove both folders "[i]menus[/i]" and "[i]Textures[/i]" in Fallout Data folder!
<br />
<br />If you installed other GUI changing mods or you are unsure, just remove following files from Fallout Data folder:
<br />
<br />[i]Data&#92;menus&#92;barter_menu.xml
<br />Data&#92;menus&#92;container_menu.xml
<br />Data&#92;menus&#92;message_menu.xml
<br />Data&#92;menus&#92;message_menu0_w-buttons.xml
<br />Data&#92;menus&#92;quantity_menu.xml
<br />Data&#92;menus&#92;recipe_menu.xml
<br />Data&#92;menus&#92;repair_services_menu.xml
<br />Data&#92;menus&#92;sleep_wait_menu.xml
<br />Data&#92;menus&#92;tutorial_menu.xml[/i]
<br />+
<br />[i]Data&#92;menus&#92;dialog&#92;dialog_menu.xml
<br />Data&#92;menus&#92;prefabs&#92;list_box.xml[/i]
<br />+
<br />[i]Data&#92;menus&#92;prefabs&#92;REVELATION_***.xml[/i] (all [i]REVELATION_[/i] files in this folder)
<br />[i]Data&#92;Textures&#92;Interface&#92;Revelation&#92;*.*[/i] (all files in this folder)
<br />
<br />
<br />[color=#FF6600][b]2010, Incompatibilities[/b][/color]
<br />There are some possible bugs on low resolutions (1024x768 and 800x600 especially). :)
<br />
<br />Some text labels in not english or russian Fallout New Vegas versions can get out their places. It may happen 'cause different word translations may differ in letters count. I'm trying to leave a reserve in text fields but nothing is unlimited. ;)
<br />

Missing Ammo Recipes 1_33 1.33.0
====================================================
By LFox for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

*****************************************************************
<br />
<br />                   Fallout New Vegas
<br />                  Missing Ammo Recipes v1.33
<br />          Made by LFox
<br />
<br />*****************************************************************
<br />
<br />     1. INSTALLING THE PLUGIN
<br />
<br />*****************************************************************
<br />
<br />1. Extract to Fallout New Vegas/Data and enable the plugin in
<br />the Fallout New Vegas Launcher.
<br />
<br />*****************************************************************
<br />
<br />     2. Mod Description
<br />
<br />*****************************************************************
<br />
<br />The game has a nice selection of ammo such as Armor Piercing and
<br />Hollow Point rounds.  However there is NOT recipes to make them
<br />which defeats the whole purpose of crafting your own ammo.  This
<br />mod is as basic as it can get, simple with no mess.  It adds the
<br />missing recipes which use the same amount of materials as
<br />handload ammo does/would.  Since they're special ammo types you
<br />need the Handloader Perk to make them thus making the perk more
<br />useful.
<br />
<br />As of v1.33 this mod requires both the Honest Hearts DLC and
<br />Gun Runner's Arsenal DLC.  If you require the split files
<br />please download an earlier version.
<br />
<br />NOTE 1: I've added a small note for the .223 Round and .38
<br />Special round in their recipe name so you know what they can
<br />be fired from.
<br />
<br />NOTE 2: The ammo types listed under the Unatural recipes section
<br />are those which had no recipes at all.  As such they do not
<br />have ammo cases and this mod does not and will not add the
<br />cases.  Instead their recipes exclude the ammo case.
<br />
<br />Below are the recipes I've added:

====================================================
By Millenia - Naky - many others for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[size=4][color=red]If you&#39;re getting crashes when applying weapon mods, install Pelinor&#39;s Weapon Mod Menu from [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/44515]here[/url].[/color][/size]<br /><br />--<br /><br />[size=4][color=red]Want to learn how to make weapons like me? I made a tutorial series in June, check it out [url=http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL925958D31D8D30C7]here[/url]&#33;[/color][/size]<br /><br />[youtube]A0fmqSPrK20[/youtube]<br /><br />*******************************<br />* WEAPONS OF THE NEW MILLENIA *<br />*******************************<br />by Team Millenia<br /><br />1. WotnM&#39;s Details<br />2. Requirements<br />3. Installation<br />4. Troubleshooting and Compatibility<br />5. Q&A<br />6. The Future<br />7. Credits and Permissions<br /><br />***************<br />* The Details *<br />***************<br /><br />This mod is simply a collection of Millenia&#39;s individually released weapons into one big pack. It was designed from the ground up to enable the community to make their own support patches, compatibility patches, or to complement it with their own mods as a resource. An emphasis was put on compatibility and modularity, so hopefully we succeeded in this area.<br /><br />Also included with the mod is a collection of several optional ESP files which you can use to enhance your gaming experience and to suit your preference. The base ESM itself will do absolutely nothing in your game - seriously, it does nothing. You need one of the support esps to add the weapons to your game in some fashion of your choice. The cheat cabinets will offer you the weapons for free, without leveled lists integration. The leveled lists will only give you the weapons from enemies and store vendors. The Honest Hearts patch will add appropriate weapons to the Grunt perk and change those weapons that are .45 caliber to use it. Finally, the store esp gives a small exploration based, unmarked quest style element to the Gun Runners HQ that ends with... nah, no spoilers.<br /><br />All in all, it&#39;s been a long time coming and we certainly apologize for the delay. Real World(tm) interfered and there you have it. At least now, if we disappear, we&#39;ve given you the tools to continue on in our stead.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />List of Weapons<br />1. 9A-91<br />2. AEK-972<br />3. AK-47<br />4.

GALIL<br /><br />END OF FNV RELEASES<br /><br />******<br />*v1.1*<br />******<br />- Aug A1, KS-23, TOZ-34, FN FNC, GSh-18, PB-6P9, G36K added.<br />- Aug A1 now has iron sights as the default, the scope is a mod.<br />- Heffy compatible animation files/support have been included as an optional install. (Manual install only.)<br />- New lite alternate store module esp for those having crashing problems. No idea if this will fix your problems, but it&#39;s an attempt to troubleshoot at least by cutting out the entire Gun Runners HQ and the mini-quest.<br />- New FOMOD script.<br />- CaliberX support has been dropped. (The CaliberX guys did a better job than us, they have their support file available on their page)<br />- All support esps have been updated to add the new weapons where appropriate.<br />- 1911 for the Honest Hearts esp should drop .45 instead of 10mm now.<br />- AN94 incorrectly using PBS1 instead of PBS4 is fixed.<br />- C96 and Duplet leveled lists have been fixed.<br />- Super mutants not being able to use assault rifles have had their toys removed.<br />- C96 used another gun in the pack&#39;s ID in the leveled lists. (Yep, the C96 was a mess, I guess.)<br />- Beretta M92FS has correct textures for both the regular and Inox.<br />- TTW support esps made by T3T have been included as optional files. (Manual install only.)<br />- Lower resolution textures offered as an optional install for the TOZ-34. (Manual install only.)<br /><br />****************<br />* Requirements *<br />****************<br /><br />1.5GB of HD space - ~500MB compressed, ~1.5GB uncompressed.<br /><br />While not mandatory, we feel that The Weapon Mod Menu - http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/44515 - should be used by all who use this pack. Plus it&#39;s known to fix crashes while applying weapon mods to our guns for whatever reason. Weapon mod crash reports will be ignored if you&#39;re not using this mod.<br /><br />We also heavily, heavily, heavily recommend using Weapon Animation Replacers - http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/38527 - We recommend it in general for all the little animation bug fixes as well as new/modified animations it provides. Critical animation resources have been packaged in with the mod, but this mod is still recommended. Animation related bug reports will be ignored if you&#39;re not using this mod. <br /><br />****************<br />* Installation *<br />****************<br /><br />If you are using the FOMOD, use FOMM/NMM to activate and deactivate the mod as you wish and install whatever optional ESPs you would like to use.<br /><br />If you are installing manually, copy and paste the contents of the rar file into your Data folder. You shouldn&#39;t overwrite anything but if you do... click yes. Also, if you are installing manually and want to install the optional store, go into that folder and copy and paste the contents into your Data folder. <br /><br />As of the 1.1 update, there are some new other optional files only available by installing manually - some lower res textures for the TOZ-34, Heffy animation support files, and some TTW support esps made by T3T. If you wish to use these, well, you probably know how to install them by now.<br /><br />Uninstalling all of the old individual mods is recommended, but this pack will NOT affect any of those weapons in game even though they will overwrite physical assets. Everything has new IDs assigned to it.<br /><br />Should you want to uninstall, deactivate the FOMOD or simply navigate to the meshes/weapons and textures/weapons folder and delete the MMP folders in both along with the esm/p files to remove most of the mod.<br /><br />***********************************<br />* Troubleshooting and Compability *<br />***********************************<br /><br />This mod was not heavily tested with other mods; heck, it was hardly tested at all. Give us a shout if we done broke stuff. Maybe we&#39;ll fix it.<br /><br />However, if you use the gun vendor module, be aware that it will conflict with any game that modifies the Gun Runners HQ.<br /><br />All iron sights have been calibrated for use with Weapons Animation Replacer and these are the only iron sights we will support at this time. If your iron sights are not right and you&#39;re not using WAR, we will not be releasing non-WAR supported iron sights at this time. <br /><br />*********<br />* Q & A *<br />*********<br /><br />Q: Why are all the esps separate? I only wanted one&#33;<br /><br />A: Well, you&#39;re not the only one who wants things a certain way. Over all of our releases, we&#39;ve heard a lot of different requests for different things by many different people. Some people didn&#39;t like how we added the weapons to the leveled lists because they wanted to be the only ones using the weapons. Some people didn&#39;t like how we gave you a free (and easily ignored) weapon in Doc&#39;s because they lack the willpower to resist taking the free gun. Some people only wanted to buy them from a store. Some people only wanted to find them in the world or as a quest reward. <br /><br />Well, we can&#39;t please everyone. So we designed the pack so that it would be easy for everyone to make their own support mods using Millenia&#39;s art assets. We&#39;ve included some base esps that can be used as is or as examples for you to make your own. <br /><br />Don&#39;t like the weapon balance? It&#39;s easy as pie to make your own rebalance esp now. Don&#39;t like free copies? If you don&#39;t use the cabinet esp, you won&#39;t get them. Don&#39;t like leveled lists integration? Don&#39;t use that optional esp. <br /><br />Q: The game crashes when I add mods to the guns&#33;<br /><br />A: We answered this already, but we hear it so often... use The Weapon Mod Menu - http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/44515 - this seems to fix it. We don&#39;t know the cause, but we heavily suspect our nif exporter. Either way, WMM seems to cure the problem. Seriously, we will ignore all reports of weapon mods crashing your game. We know it does it, we don&#39;t know why, and we know that WMM seems to fix it 99% of the time. Good enough for us.<br /><br />Q: Will you update this pack after every new weapon release?<br /><br />A: No, probably every 5 guns or so. Ish.<br /><br />Q: Would/Could you do [gun request/suggestion]? It would be awesome&#33;<br /><br />A: Thanks, but we don&#39;t do requests. <br /><br />Q: Where are all the easter egg guns?<br /><br />A: Still in the ESM. They&#39;re just more or less unused. You can still check them out in the cheat cabinets. <br /><br />Q: The speedloader stays on my revolver and won&#39;t go away&#33;<br /><br />A: This happens in the vanilla game too. We&#39;re not exactly sure what or how to fix it aside from what we&#39;ve already done.<br /><br />Q: Sometimes the bullets go nowhere near where the sights are? Fix it&#33;<br /><br />A: This is very likely an engine bug that can be fixed by using Ironsights Camera Recoil Removal - http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/44253/? - Give it a try.<br /><br />Q: I want to release a support plugin. Do I have permission and how can I release it?<br /><br />A: Just create a new plugin using our .esm as the master. Please don&#39;t include assets from the pack in your release, but plugins are fine. If you&#39;re unsure, always ask first.<br /><br />Q: Where are the cheat cabinets located?<br /><br />A: Between the saloon and Chet&#39;s in Goodsprings next to the workbenches. If you can&#39;t find it there, the plugin is likely not activated. <br /><br />Q: Where/how do I start the gun vendor mod?<br /><br />A: Enter Gun Runners HQ and investigate.<br /><br />Q: Where is the old CaliberX plugin?<br /><br />A: It&#39;s now unsupported and dropped by us. The folks over at CaliberX&#39;s page on Nexus have created a better support patch than we did so you should head on over there and grab it.<br /><br />Q: Will you include MTindle&#39;s/Naky&#39;s weapons into the pack; you all work together, right?<br /><br />A: Naky&#39;s weapons have been integrated but Millenia has no plans to include MTindle&#39;s separate releases at this time. <br /><br />Q: The Gun Runners store module crashes for me, what should I do?<br /><br />A: We have released a LITE version of the module. ONLY USE IT and give it a shot. Our Vendortron can now be found next to the other Gun Runners vendortron. This likely conflicts like hell with other mods but what the heck - let&#39;s see if this solves people&#39;s problems first. Also, using the FNV4GB exe appears to resolve the issue for many users as well. <br /><br />Q: Millenia did a Mossberg and a rusty MAC-10, why aren&#39;t they in this pack?<br /><br />A: They are not up to his current standards of quality and they are considered discontinued mods. Perhaps one day they will be remade but until then, they are dead mods.<br /><br />**************<br />* The Future *<br />**************<br /><br />There&#39;s always more to do, fix, add and implement. Always. Whether or not we do it is a whole other thing.<br /><br />***************************<br />* Credits and Permissions *<br />***************************<br /><br />LEGAL STUFF<br />------------<br /><br />Absolutely under no circumstances can this mod be re-uploaded anywhere other than the Nexus nor can any of the content within it be used for commercial or monetary gain of any kind. This includes the artwork (all models and textures) being ported for use in other games, upcoming or existing. Do not bother asking for permission to use the artwork with the intent for commercial purposes - now or in the future - it will not be granted. <br /><br />TEAM MILLENIA<br />-------------<br />Millenia - The Talent<br />Naky - The Screw Up<br />MediocrityGoggles - The Sperg<br /><br />THE CONTRIBUTORS<br />----------------<br /><br />Thanks to everyone for letting me texture their guns.

This perk is included in my other mod &#34; [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62920]Some Perks[/url] &#34; in a better manner. <br /><br />A perk that gives immunity to addiction.<br />I think the developers should have made such a perk - high level one- instead of [url=http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Chem_Resistant_(perk)]Chem Resistant[/url] so i made one.<br />

Anatomic Perks 1.0.0
====================================================
By Migck for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[center][u][b][size=6]Anatomic Perks[/size][/b][/u][/center]
<br />[right][i]you can't spell "anatomic" without "atomic"...[/i][/right]
<br />
<br />[size=3]The Living Anatomy perk grants the player an effect to see any and all target's HP and DT next to their health bars, when it appears onscreen. Issues with the feature aside, it kinda grated me that this works for ALL kinds of enemies, despite Living Anatomy being a Medicine perk and its other effect being a minor damage bonus against humans. So with a minor in anatomy, apparently you also become able to tell a robot's weak spots.
<br />
<br />I suppose it's still balanced, since otherwise the perk wouldn't have much going for it. But if you think like me, here I've provided a system to recognize what kind of enemy's health bar is in sight, and specified certain perks to be able to trigger the HP and DT scan depending on that:
<br />[/size][list]
<br />[*][size=3]Living Anatomy now only allows you to see the HP and DT of humans and non-feral ghouls. But its damage bonus against them is upped to 10%, and it also increases HP recovered when you heal by 10%.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Robotics Expert allows you to see the HP and DT of robots. It now also utilizes a form list for robots that should be immune to shutdown attempts, PerkRoboticsExpertExclude, if you're interested.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Entomologist had its description fixed [i][b]BECAUSE FOR STARTERS, SCORPIONS ARE NOT FRIGGIN "INSECTS", PEOPLE...[/b][/i] sorry, I flipped out for a sec there... it allows you to see the HP and DT of... erm... [i]arthropods[/i], and its requirements were changed: from 45 Survival AND 4 INT, to 45 Survival OR 40 Science. Because Entomology is about Science, not cooking (yet).[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Hunter allows you to see the Hp and Dt of all kinds of... featherless birds, yeah, that'll work [size=1]shut up Diogenes[/size]. A patch is provided for the bear traps in [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64338]this other mod of mine[/url]﻿, so that Hunter can also keep the bear trap knockdown feature. Load after both these mods if you want to use it.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Purifier allows you to see the hP and dT of all kinds of Abominations, Feral Ghouls and Super Mutants. It now has an 8 Strength requirement, because you have to admit feeling capable of mowing down a Deathclaw in melee requires some stronkness.[/size]
<br />[/list][size=3]
<br />And that covers all enemy classes in the game. There is, however, one final option to kinda forget about this: the Here and Now perk, which I've struggled to justify ever using it in my playthroughs, now allows to see the Hp and dT of all enemies, like Living Anatomy did. It also gives the whole amount of experience to clear your current level, instead of only what it takes to reach the next one, so you are assured to not receive less than maximum experience for having advanced to the next level with any experience "overflow". It now requires an 8 in Perception OR the Educated perk.
<br />So, if you're only interested in the "enemy scan" feature against everything, Here and Now can be a good choice, while the other specific perks should grant more useful combat bonuses against specific enemy types as well.
<br />
<br />Conflicts with other mods altering the listed perks. YMMV, lrn2use FNVEdit and waste your own time.
<br />
<br />Hope you find it good enough. Feel free to make improvement suggestions, and enjoy.[/size]

The Story So Far[/size]<br /><br />[center][youtube]eCijaeSAXsE[/youtube][/center]<br />[/color][img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/130/images/50146-1-1443182500.jpg[/img][color=#e69138]<br /><br />[size=6]3. Installation<br />[/size][/color]<br />-Simply unzip the file into your /Fallout New Vegas/Data folder. <br />-By default, using Steam, it&#39;s in the : Steam/Steamapps/common/Fallout New Vegas/Data<br />-Launch Fallout New Vegas, in the starting menu, click on &#34;Data Files&#34; and check the &#34;Autumn Leaves&#34; Box.<br /><br />[img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/130/images/50146-11-1443182500.jpg[/img]<br />[color=#e69138]<br />[size=6]4. Where to Start?[/size][/color]<br /><br />As soon as you get outside, your Pip-Boy will pick-up a new radio signal - as New Vegas does for all new DLCs - and add a new Marker on your World Map :<br />Hypatia, where Autumn Leaves takes place. You will be able to fast-travel there, if you choose so. It&#39;s east of Novac.<br /><br />[img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/130/images/50146-12-1443182499.jpg[/img]<br /><br />[color=#e69138][size=6]5. FAQ[/size][/color]<br /><br />[color=#f6b26b][size=4]- What&#39;s the ideal character level for playing Autumn Leaves?[/size][/color]<br /><br />Autumn Leaves content is accessible to all characters. Its rewards - New Exclusive Perks - will be interesting for Low Level and High Level characters alike.<br />Hypatia is situated not far from Novac for a reason, though, skill checks are mainly aimed for a low-mid level character, as the Courier is supposed to be around these parts. There is also one quest influenced by what you did in New Vegas up to that point.<br /><br />Anyhow, level 1 or level 50, feel free to tackle Hypatia when you feel like it.<br /><br />It is recommended to play in Hardcore, as some interactions only unlock in that mode.<br /><br />[color=#f6b26b][size=4]- What&#39;s the general feel of the mod? What are your inspirations?[/size][/color]<br /><br />The previous [b][u]Fallouts, Planescape : Torment, Arcanum[/u][/b]. These games had such an impact on how I see RPG that I wouldn’t be able to escape their influence, even if I wanted to. These games are heavily-based on investigation, skill checks, player choices and dialogs. I&#39;m kinda old-school, that way, and wish to pay tribute to the guys that made those games.<br /><br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/130/images/50146-9-1443182500.jpg[/img]<br /><br />[color=#f6b26b][size=4]- Who I got to thank for this?<br /><br />[/size][/color]A lot of fine people you&#39;ll see in the credits below. Everyone working on this has been doing pro-quality jobs - Most of the time because they are already professionals, often in the gaming industry. Voice Actors have been putting a lot of themselves in their roles, always exceeding what I expected for their characters. They invested a lot of time and efforts to deliver convincing lines, and make the characters even more relatable, loveable, heart-wrenching, or simply incredibly funny.<br /><br />All of these people have been doing stellar jobs. If I got one thing out of this mod, it&#39;s the strong desire to work again with them, in a project with a larger scope - and budget. Again, they have been doing pro-jobs - sometimes in very hard conditions - and it pains me that they have to go unpaid.<br /><br />Notable shout-outs goes to :<br />-JohnnyUtah, who has been kind enough to invest himself in a project with someone he barely met, when he already has enough to do with his own game. He also went out of his way to rewrite a lot of Rolland&#39;s lines, and provide us with his unparalleled dark humor. His cartoons were one of my foremost inspirations for Rolland in the first place, and I feel *very* lucky that he accepted to do this.<br />-Pablo Coma, the composer who also have Healer Quest in the works. If you cry sheer tears of emotion playing this, it&#39;ll be probably thanks to him.<br />-My significant other, for her clever advices, merciless feedbacks and constant support.<br /><br />[img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/130/images/50146-3-1443182500.jpg[/img]<br /><br />[color=#f6b26b][size=4]- I&#39;m kinda stuck.<br />[/size][/color]<br />I provided a walkthrough in the files. Keep in mind that Autumn Leaves keep tracks of several of your choices, and that the critical path detailed in the Walkthrough doesn&#39;t take every possibility into account.<br /><br />The lack of quest compass is deliberate. I tried to provide enough hints, through conversations, details and left-out items to let the players solve the quests in the way that they see fit.<br /><br />[color=#f6b26b][size=4]- Who are you?[/size][/color]<br /><br />Thirty-ish belgian guy living in France, having worked for a while in PC-Gaming Online Distribution. Began working on Autumn Leaves more than 4 years ago simply because I simply love video games. I reached point in my life where I felt I had to do something to get closer to what I want to do : writing and designing games. So I began working on this project to educate myself on how to make them, to have something to show, learn how to write, learn how to script, learn how to level design. I learned as I went, usually painfully. <br /><br />If it wasn&#39;t for the incredibly helping community, free resources, tools and tutorials on the Internet, I would&#39;ve failed miserably. <br />I cannot stress this last part enough.<br /><br />[color=#f6b26b][size=4]- 7-10 Hours of Gameplay? That&#39;s DLC&#39;s scope, there, pal.[/size][/color]<br /><br />Initially, the project wasn&#39;t as big in scope as it is now. I only wanted to create a small quest-hub with funny dialogs. Things went bigger than expected, and I discovered I wanted to tell many - many more -  things with Autumn Leaves. I grew attached to the characters and their struggles, and wanted to use them to explore various topics I care deeply about. Do it all in an entertaining, funny way and try to avoid any kind of pompous posturing.<br /><br />[img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/130/images/50146-4-1443182500.jpg[/img]<br /><br />[color=#f6b26b][size=4]- What&#39;s next?[/size][/color]<br /><br />It will depend on your feedback, ladies & gents. If Autumn Leaves is successful enough, I would like making a stand-alone version and integrate all the ridiculous ideas that couldn&#39;t fit into this version, expand on it and develop a new gameplay. I will begin to work for other mod projects and begin looking for a job into a gaming studio. I will continue to support, fix, tweak, improve Autumn Leaves, of course, so don&#39;t hesitate and report those nasty bugs to me as well as feedback on your own experience with the game. Keep in mind that being alone on the technical part, updates may take a while, depending on my schedule. <br /><br />I also intend to &#34;let&#39;s play&#34; the mod on Twitch, for a &#34;Commentary Playthrough&#34; : speak of the mod&#39;s development, reveal some secrets about the story and gameplay, and generally answer questions. Follow me on [url=https://twitter.com/BaronVonChateau]Twitter [/url]for how and when it&#39;ll happen.<br /><br />[color=#f6b26b][size=4]- What ENB Preset did you use for your screenshots?[/size][/color]<br /><br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53521/?]Dynamo ENB[/url], with grain. &lt;3 <br />Heavily recommended.<br /><br />[color=#e69138][size=6]6. KNOWN ISSUES & UPDATES[/size][/color]<br /><br />The central area in Autumn Leaves - the Atrium - takes up some resources. Though it is not enough to worry 99% of configs (the mod was tested on a low-end rig from 6 years ago without problems), some crashes were observed when popping up the Pip-Boy a short time after having picked up a lot of items and clutter at once. In any case, save often.<br /><br />FOR EVERYONE having a problem where the book and terminal only answers (...) or &#34;Hey.&#34;, you must uninstall your T60 power armor mod. Thanks to Cybell for providing the solution&#33;<br /><br />UPDATE 17/10/2015 :<br />-To all people having a problem with the Helena&#39;s Book and &#34;Terminal&#34; responding simply &#34;hey&#34; when being talked to, please try the optional file uploaded today. Tell me if this solves the problem for you&#33;<br /><br />UPDATE 18/10/2015 :<br />-The ending slideshows have been sped up, and should take far less time to unfold. Problem came from missing lip files. Main File is now updated. Thanks to ZuTheSkunk for providing the solution&#33;<br /><br />UPDATE 24/10/2015<br />-Fixed a lot of typos/errors/mismatches audio/sub for James<br /><br />UPDATE 26/10/2015<br />-Fixed most of Rolland and Arthur&#39;s subtitles - Typos, mistakes, mismatches audio/subs - remaining mismatches are due to the engine&#39;s limitation of 150 characters per line.<br /><br />[color=#e69138][size=6]7.

B42 Melee Bash 0.5b 0.5.0
====================================================
By B42 for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/MVzuR5s.png[/img]
<br />[color=#ffa383][b][size=4]This mod adds melee attacks for non-melee weapons,
<br />similar to melee hits and buttstrokes in modern FPS games.
<br />Full support of all non-melee weapons, with multiple unique attack animations per weapon type.
<br />Fully integrated into the skill system, complemented with variety of perks, and extra features.
<br />This mod is part of the Project B42.[/size][/b][/color]
<br />
<br />
<br />[youtube]Zax1u8ba0P8[/youtube]
<br />
<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/V97h5dI.png[/img]
<br />[b][size=4][color=#ffa383]
<br />Melee bash for every weapon type in the game, from pistols to two-handed launchers
<br />Visual damage implementation. If you hit it - it will bleed.
<br />Two completely different aiming modes to choose from:[/color][/size]
<br />- Precise: you hit where you aim. Good for taking out limbs, weapons out of enemy hands.
<br />- Fallout 4 mode: your melee bashes always hit the target, mimicking FO4 behavior
<br />
<br />[size=4][color=#ffa383]Well-balanced. Bash will cost AP and, on hardcore only, weapon condition. So don't go bashing walls.
<br />Crippling hits, criticals, knockdowns and knockouts - all supported and implemented
<br />Complete support of vanilla and mod-added perks that alter:[/color][/size]
<br />AP consumption, damage, crit (% and damage), and enemy DT.
<br />
<br />[size=4][color=#ffa383]Ability to bash and break open locks.
<br />Bash something to attract hostiles with the sound.
<br />And much, much more unlocked with Bash perks.[/color][/size]
<br />
<br />Only thing this mod ignores and does not do - it will not increase your damage-based game challenges
<br />Because technically you're not using melee weapons, and you're not exactly shooting at stuff either.[/b]
<br />
<br />
<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/6QL16IW.png[/img]
<br />[color=#ffca98][b]Press Bash Key (X by default) to hurt people violently with your rifle buttstock, pistol grip, you name it.
<br />
<br />Press the same key to bash open locks (you need a perk, but more on that later),
<br />but be careful, if you're being seen bashing locked stuff, people will aggro at you if they own it.
<br />
<br />If you want to attract attention of hostiles, just bash something solid. It'll make enough sound to draw some attention.
<br />
<br />Damage you inflict is based on your melee skill, weapon type (light, medium, heavy), and weapon weight.
<br />AP drain is also based off your perks, so if you want to bash more - grab some of those vanilla "Reduce AP cost" perks.
<br />Your hits will always stagger your target for a brief moment. And there's a small chance to knockdown the target,
<br />that's also based on your melee skills and target endurance. If you have Super Slam - you get +15% bonus to knockdown chance.
<br />For other fancy features, like rapid bashing, sneak attack knockOUTs, et cetera: read perks section. There's plenty of stuff.
<br />
<br />And last but not least, the more you invest into perks - the deadlier your melee bash gets.[/b][/color]

<br />Melee Bash targeting replica of the latest FO entry. Absolute best for controller users.
<br />It has significant range and always hits the target that is in player's line of sight.

<br />[color=#ffa383][b][size=4]Alternative animations fix[/size][/b][/color]
<br />Enables alternative animations that are aimed to fix rare bug, when the bash sound is being heard,

<br />As of right now, I assume most if not all mods are compatible. Or at least nothing will break.
<br />I've tested this with animation replacers and everything seems to work just fine.
<br />Due to certain scripting limitations, though, bash attacks are NOT treated as PLAYER attacks, so mods that rely on it
<br />won't apply to melee bashes. From where I stand, that's even good, because I can ensure nothing suddenly gonna make
<br />the bash useless, or overpowered, due to other mods not being aware of what's going on and applying scripts as it's firearms hit.
<br />If you found some incompatibility - please let me know.
<br />
<br />
<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/35o9BD4.png[/img]
<br />Install required mods first. They are essential and without them – this mod will not work.
<br />"B42 Melee Bash" mod installs like any other mod, manually or using a mod manager.
<br />I recommend the latter for easy uninstallation.
<br />Un-installation is same as installation, but in reverse.
<br />
<br />
<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/D53jNz8.png[/img]
<br />For them crazy animators who want to add more bashes, system is easily scalable, it picks anims at random from the POV+Weaptype folders:
<br />All you need to do is make roughly 1-second long animation, and put a sound key (check our anims for it)
<br />at the time of hit in the anim. We put hits in anims between 0.3 sec to 0.45 sec. Do not go over or below that without extensive testing!
<br />Then just put the anim inside the corresponding folder (for more info on that - check "_male&#92;idleanims&#92;B42Bash" folder)
<br />
<br />For fellow scripters who want to detect melee bash hits and the damage it caused,
<br />use the following script [b]as an example[/b]:[/center]
<br />
<br />[code]
<br />                           int iWaitForBash
<br />                           int iBashLoaded
<br />                           float fBashDamage
<br />                           Begin GameMode
<br />                              if GetGameLoaded
<br />                                 set iBashLoaded to IsModLoaded "B42Bash.esp"
<br />                              endif
<br />                              if iBashLoaded
<br />                                 set fBashDamage to Player.AuxVarGetFlt "*_MeleeBashHit"
<br />                                 if fBashDamage != 0
<br />                                    if iWaitForBash == 0
<br />                                       ;Hit happened. Do your thing
<br />                                       ;fBashDamage is bash damage, obviously
<br />                                       ;damage will reset to 0 once the bash anim stops.
<br />                                       set iWaitForBash to 1
<br />                                    endif
<br />                                 else
<br />                                    if iWaitForBash
<br />                                       set iWaitForBash to 0
<br />                                    endif
<br />                                 endif
<br />                              endif
<br />                           End

BLEEDNV 1.73.0
====================================================
By Roy Batty - Puppettron for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[center][size=3][font=Tahoma][b][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/130/images/61141-0-1476701432.png[/img][/b]
<br />Name: BLEED
<br />Authors: Roy Batty &amp; Puppettron
<br />Version: 1.7.3
<br />Date: 28/02/2019
<br />[/font][color=#efefef]
<br />
<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/130/images/61141-5-1476700535.png[/img]
<br />
<br />BLEED is an overhaul of how damage and force is applied.
<br />
<br />
<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/130/images/61141-4-1476700535.png[/img]
<br />
<br />BLEED is designed to change the way that unarmed, melee, ballistics, energy, explosives, poison, fire, electricity, plasma and shrapnel inflict damage and other effects in a challenging and more deadly way. BLEED provides enhancement to all forms of damage, and also provides more realistic knock down mechanics.
<br />
<br />
<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/130/images/61141-3-1476700535.png[/img]
<br />
<br />BLEED accomplishes this by changing damage multipliers on specific parts of anatomy or mechanical pieces. It also increases various damage over time effects, and adds a new bleeding mechanic for weapons which create shrapnel. Additionally it has added fatigue effects to blunt weapons and bleeding effects to edged weapons. This is accomplished through scripted events to remain as light as possible on the engine.
<br />
<br />
<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/130/images/61141-2-1476700535.png[/img]
<br />
<br />BLEED changes the way explosions affect entities. It makes explosions more deadly, changes the force applied, and also changes the radius.
<br />BLEED changes multipliers on specific body parts to significantly increase the damage inflicted.
<br />BLEED increases damage over time effects of electricity, plasma, fire, and poison.
<br />BLEED adds shrapnel and bleeding damage to some explosives.
<br />BLEED adds fatigue damage (KO) to blunt weapons, both melee and unarmed.
<br />BLEED adds bleeding damage to all edged and bladed weapons.
<br />BLEED adds crippling effects to all critical hits.
<br />
<br />What type of player is BLEED designed for?
<br />
<br />Only you can answer that. However BLEED was designed to enhance the Role Play aspects of some weapons so that ballistic or traditional energy weapons are not the only choice. Playing as a Pyro, Demo or Berzerker and using poisons is now much more feasible. It was also designed to increase the effectiveness of Melee, Unarmed, Ballistic, Explosive and Energy weapons.
<br />
<br />

<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/130/images/61141-6-1476700535.png[/img]
<br />
<br />BLEED should be compatible with any mod with the exception of ones which alter Body Part Data, Explosions, or Damage Effects.
<br />
<br />Creating a feature or compatibility patch for these mods (such as EVE, YUP, TTWFixes, MMUE, Ragdolls etc) is encouraged.
<br />
<br />Realistic Weapon Damage is incompatible as this mod supersedes it.

BNB_Body 1.0.0
====================================================
By thaumx Mkageyama for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

WARNING: This mod contains nudity. It replaces the default body with a nude version that has a detailed texture. It also animates breasts causing them to move, and replaces most female armors with versions that are skimpier and/or sexier, and also may display nudity. If this not for you, or you are not legal age to use this mod in your country, please do not install it or complain about it! You have been warned.
<br />
<br />UPDATE - 08/2012
<br />Let me apologize to everyone for the lack of support for this mod over the last year and a half. I've been traipsing around to locations with little to no internet connectivity. Because of that, I had to cut short some improvements I had been planning, and focus on just getting a "complete" mod done without the extra options. (more clothing support for different body types, and a more "realistic"/less sexy version of the clothing. Along with a few other supported things.) While I'm still quite busy at the moment, I'm hoping to be able to do some more work to this mod. -Thaumx
<br />
<br />I am pleased to introduce the Bouncing Natural Breasts mod for Fallout New Vegas. This mod represents literally months of effort on the part of several authors. While this mod’s primary authors are Thaumx and Mkageyama, It is important to know that we have in several areas built on the efforts of mod creators who came before us. (With appropriate permissions!) So please see the credits section which lists everyone’s contributions.
<br />
<br />COMPLETE DESCRIPTION IN THE README! Readme contains installation instructions, troubleshooting, credits, etc.
<br />
<br />PLEASE DOWNLOAD ALL THREE MAIN FILES. README is in BNB_BODY
<br />
<br />Features
<br />
<br />•   Complete Body Replacer - this mod replaces the default female body to a larger-breasted BNB version. The new mesh and textures provide a realistic (for the game engine) nude body.
<br />
<br />•   Animated Breasts - this mod replaces the default skeleton with a version that includes breast bones. All the meshes (including armor!) have been weighted to the bones so that they work with the complete set of replaced animation files. This means female model breasts will bounce and sway when walking, running, jumping, dancing, etc.
<br />
<br />•   Armor Replacer - this mod replaces all but the most obscure female armors (over 90% of female armors!) with armors that match the BNB body. These armors are skimpier and sexier, and have animated breasts.
<br />
<br />•   Old Woman Sanitizer™ - this mod uses an additional armor set to keep old women wearing the default Fallout armors. No more grandmas in skimpy clothing! It also uses two separate bodies for “Old” and “OldAged” women, as well as a separate texture for the oldest women.
<br />
<br />•   Specialty Armors – this mod includes a few specialty armors that are available for free in Goodsprings. They are found in Victor’s shack in the “BNB Wardrobe” and will respawn every 3 days.
<br />
<br />•   Instructions are included to convert YOUR armor to the BNB skeleton. 
<br />
<br />•   Reworked animations - All the standard animations like walking, sneaking, jumping, swimming, and even the “prostitute dance” have been redone to include moving breasts.  Little things have been included as well, like having breasts hang more vertical away from the body when leaning forward sneaking .
<br />
<br />NOTE: Please check the troubleshooting section BEFORE posting a problem in the comments section. You'll most likely get your issue resolved quicker that way :)

Description
===========
This replaces the textures of Joshua Graham, a.k.a. The Burned Man, with ones that better reflect the 
character art. Also fixes the head bandages so that they not only conform to differing head shapes, but 
also makes it react to mouth and jaw movement like real bandages would.


Details
=======
Joshua Graham now actually looks like he\'s suffered severe burns and his bandages, both on his 
head and body, look like gauze like they\'re supposed to. The new design and details are meant to 
closely mirror that of the Burned Man we see on the Honest Hearts DLC cover. 

Please note that anybody who has mods making Joshua Graham\'s clothing playable will no longer be 
able to see the head wrap. However, if you use the console to go into the character creation screen, 
(showracemenu) the head wrap will be available under the \"Facial Hair\" tab. Oddly enough, that\'s 
the only way to get it to react to mouth movements. This also allows you to wear any hat with the 
wrap as well. You\'ll need a bald hairstyle to use the wrap properly though. I may include that later for 
those who don\'t have any mods that add one. There\'s also a copy of the default male eyebrows  so 
they can be added again when you decide you don\'t want to wear the wrap anymore. 


Install
=======
This one\'s easy to install. Just drop the \"Better Burned Man.esp\" and it\'s matching \"Better Burned 
Man - Main.bsa\" into your data folder. Activate the mod in your mod manager of choice.

Requires the Honest Hearts DLC to function. 


Uninstall
=========
Simply delete the .esp and .bsa files associated with the mod.


Known Issues or Bugs
====================
None yet. Tell me if you find some.


History
=======
- 5/24/11
First version. May not even need to make future updates. 


Credits
=======
Couldn\'t have been made without the 
help of:

Blender
NifSkope
The Conformulator
Adobe Photoshop

And it definitely wouldn\'t have been 
possible without Bethesda and Obsidian.


Tools Used
==========
- Blender
- Adobe Photoshop
- NifSkope
- The Conformulator
- NV GECK


Licensing/Legal
===============
I normally wouldn\'t mind sharing my work 
freely, however due to the guarded 
nature of DLC materials, the armor 
textures may not be reused. The skin 
textures though can be used however 
you see fit. If anybody wants to make a 
full burned body and make a playable 
race out of it too, more power to you.

====================================================

[color=#ff7700][size=5][b][u]Features:
<br />[/u][/b][/size][/color]- SPECIAL allocation, skill allocation, traits, and hardcore now all take place at the Vigor Tester instead of the exam (optional file keeps the exam for those who want it)
<br />- Wild Wasteland is now selectable via a pop-up menu after SPECIAL allocation, similar to hardcore mode
<br />- Get specialized gear based on your tag skills (edited version of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/68721]Starting Gear Overhaul[/url])
<br />- Removes Doc's line about the player's name
<br />- Includes an improved method of the character respec (both vanilla and OWB) removing traits, so it doesn't remove Wild Wasteland and automatically removes both vanilla and modded traits (based on [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69261]Traits on Level up[/url])
<br />- Doesn't move/remove the Pre-Order Pack DLC items, for that I recommend either JSawyer or JSawyer Ultimate Edition

====================================================
By Chinpoko117 for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

Yet another mounted vehicle prop from Black Ops Cold War converted into a usable weapon for all your heavy weapon needs. Features a single shield mod for increased weapon condition,. custom sounds and complete leveled list integration so it'll appear on enemies (Raiders, Jackals and Super Mutants) and vendors such as the Gun Runners. There's no custom ammo and I don't think even Caliber has the proper ammunition so it uses vanilla .50 BMG. A free test copy is also once again inside the Abandoned Shack near Goodsprings.
<br />
<br />Enjoy!

I was skeptical at first but this weapon ended up turning out great. It was a mounted weapon prop from Black Ops Cold War believe it or not, and it didn't even come with the 106mm shells! I had to find one on Sketchfab lol. But enough about that, here's the mod! The M40 Recoilless Rifle is an 106mm anti-tank weapon but can be used in an anti-personnel role as well. No custom sounds this time (can't find any to fit this, but that may change later) however it does includes custom ammo that can be bought on vendors such as the Gun Runners along with the weapon itself and two weapon attachments - a shield and long barrel. It has been injected into the NCR Heavy Trooper's leveled list as well. There's also a free test copy and 1000 shells in a cheat footlocker inside the Abandoned Shack near Goodsprings.
<br />
<br />Let me know of any issues and I'll see what I can do, enjoy!

Bottle That Water 1_040 0.0.0-
====================================================
By LFox for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

*****************************************************************
<br />
<br />                   Fallout New Vegas
<br />                     Bottle That Water v1.05
<br />          Made by LFox
<br />
<br />*****************************************************************
<br />
<br />     1. INSTALLING THE PLUGIN
<br />
<br />*****************************************************************
<br />
<br />1. Extract to Fallout New Vegas/Data and enable Bottle That
<br />Water in the Fallout New Vegas Launcher.
<br />
<br />*****************************************************************
<br />
<br />     2. Mod Description
<br />
<br />*****************************************************************
<br />
<br />IMPORTANT: As of v1.05+ this mod requires the Old World Blues
<br />DLC.
<br />
<br />KNOWN ISSUES: Currently bottling water from irradiated water
<br />surfaces will result in pure water.  Sinks, pumps ect will
<br />bottle correctly since they are done via different scripts.
<br />This won't be fixed until i can figure out how to determine if
<br />the water has rads or not.
<br />
<br />This mod allows you to bottle water from all water sources
<br />without an annoying menu.  It also adds a buyable canteen that
<br />will keep you automatically hydrated (see further down for
<br />details).  Empty water bottles as well as the canteen can be
<br />bought from Chet in Goodsprings.
<br />
<br />When you use a water source while sneaking you automatically
<br />fill all empty water bottles.  If you bottle water from a pure
<br />water source all dirty bottles will be rebottled as pure water
<br />alongside refilling empty bottles as well as filling up your
<br />canteen if you have one.  Empty water bottles are
<br />automatically attained when drinking irradiated, dirty or
<br />purified water as well as when you refill your canteen.
<br />
<br />The water bottled is either dirty or purified.  You gain dirty
<br />from any water with rads and purified from any water without
<br />rads.  By having only these two types this is completely
<br />compatible with mods that purify dirty water.
<br />
<br />Recipes
<br />*******
<br />Two new recipes have been added to allow you to bottle water
<br />from Prickly Pear Fruit.  One recipe requires an empty water
<br />bottle the other requires a dirty water bottle.
<br />
<br />Canteen
<br />********
<br />IMPORTANT: Buy only 1 canteen having more than 1 is useless and
<br />may mess things up.  The extra stock is in case you lose it.
<br />
<br />The canteen has a capacity of 4 sips of water.  Whenever
<br />you're dehydration goes higher than 50 and you are not in combat
<br />you'll automatically take a sip from the canteen.  You can also
<br />manually take a sip by activating the canteen.  One sip of water
<br />will restore 25 dehydration.  The amount of water left in the
<br />canteen is visible when mousing over it in your inventory.
<br />
<br />The canteen is automatically refilled with water from purified
<br />water bottles when it runs out of water.  A single bottle of
<br />purified water will be consumed, you will receive 1 empty
<br />bottle of water and a message will appear briefly to notify you
<br />that the canteen has been refilled.
<br />
<br />If you run out of purified water the canteen will not be
<br />refilled until you find some.  If you attempt to manually use
<br />it you will be told the canteen is empty.  Finally when you
<br />refill water at a pure water source your canteen will be
<br />replenished alongside everything else.
<br />
<br />NOTE 1: Actual water surfaces have a Bottle Water option, sinks
<br />ect do not.  This is due to the fact that the game Crashes to
<br />Desktop otherwise.
<br />
<br />NOTE 2: The canteen doesn't have its own inventory picture.
<br />This is due to the fact the modders resource did not include it.
<br />
<br />Q: Why not allow all bottle types?
<br />A: Because it's unnecessary.  Really think about it you need at
<br />most 20 bottles.  Once you have them what are you gonna do with
<br />all the thousands of extras?  Besides this way it stops the
<br />bizarre model morphing that occurs.  How does that soda bottle
<br />turn into a tiny plastic water bottle?
<br />
<br />Q: What water sources are included?
<br />A: ALL, that means lakes, puddles, sinks, water fountains,
<br />fire hydrants, toilets and even urinals.  If it's got water you
<br />can bottle it.
<br />
<br />Q: Why can i only do it while i'm sneaking?
<br />A: Because i HATE having things interfering with otherwise
<br />quick to use actions.  I hated all other water mods because
<br />they filled bottles 1 at a time or added an annoying menu
<br />when i tried to take a drink.
<br />
<br />*****************************************************************
<br />
<br />     3. Version History
<br />
<br />*****************************************************************
<br />
<br />v1.05
<br />- Added a line to the Sink's scripting to allow you to use the
<br />  bottle function immediately (seriously wtf? i can drink from it
<br />  ffs), you can still acquire the note and upgrade it though
<br />  through the quest
<br />- Added my bottles to the bottle list by changing the script,
<br />  the dialog conditions AND the formlist of empty bottles
<br />
<br />v1.04
<br />- Added 2 new recipes for cactus water thanks to Lanternless for
<br />  the suggestion
<br />- Modified the prefix for water so it sorts better it's now
<br />  Drink: Bottle of
<br />
<br />v1.03
<br />- Added a canteen to automatically monitor your dehydration level
<br />- Added the canteen and empty water bottles for sale from Chet in
<br />  Goodsprings
<br />- The following now have the prefix Drink: in front of them.
<br />  Dirty Water, Irradiated Water, Purified Water
<br />
<br />v1.02
<br />- Changed water surfaces such as lakes, troughs to default to
<br />  pure water it will now also change dirty water bottles into pure
<br />
<br />v1.01
<br />- Made it so dirty water is automatically rebottled as pure water
<br />when bottling from a pure water source
<br />
<br />v1.0
<br />- Ported the Plugin over from Fallout 3

CAGE 1.3.9.2 1.9.3

[color=orange][size=8] CAGE - Continue After Game&#39;s Ending [/color][/size]1.9.3<br /><br />[color=orange][size=4] Update&#33; [/size][/color]<br /><br />1.9.3.2: Thanks to LordFrostcraig for cleaned up scripts. Anyone that downloaded this version and the plugin requires the previous version to work please download this version again as I goofed up in GECK and uploaded a version that depended on the previous esp. Sorry&#33; :/<br /><br /><br />[color=orange][size=4] Description [/size][/color]<br /><br />This mod will allow you to play on after the game&#39;s ending. The slideshow will begin and you will then be loaded into the Wasteland. You will be able to do quests, explore and play other mods normally.<br /><br />[color=#e69138][size=4]<br />Current Features<br />[/size][/color]<br />Explore the Mojave till your hearts content, and then some more. CAGE allows you to play every side-quest and DLC post-game. Once you get bored of that you can install mods, CAGE only touches 3 scripts so it should work with virtually everything.<br /><br />So basically, you can play after the games ending.<br /><br />[color=orange][size=4]<br />Planned Features<br />[/size][/color]<br />I want the Mojave Wasteland to dynamically adapt to the user&#39;s ending, meaning if they side with the NCR for the ending then the NCR shall be the dominant power in the Mojave, and the land, settlements and characters will change to reflect that ending. The same vision goes for all of the endings, Caesar&#39;s ending, House&#39;s ending, Indie ending.<br /><br />Not only that, but smaller factions will be affected as well e.g BOS, Boomers, Khans. Depending on how you interacted with these factions during the Main Quest and through various Side Quests their fate in the post game Mojave will also be interpreted through changes in their numbers and where they appear in the Mojave. Locations and NPCs will also be influenced by these factions as they did play a somewhat big role in what Major faction took the Dam.<br /><br />Quests, yes, the post-game Mojave won&#39;t be a boring place with nothing to do, I plan to add lots of quests. These quests will be mulled over and ensured they are as lore friendly and immersive as possible. Through these I will build a post-game narrative fitting of the game. Also, parts of the Main Quest and side quests may be failed if you complete the game without doing them as they may not make sense anymore in a post-game world.<br /><br />Those are my main goals for now, along with providing a bug free stable mod. In the even further future I hope to add new content like weapons, armor, NPCs (fully voiced of course), followers, new locations within and outside of the Mojave and many more ideas.<br /><br />(Problem with all of this is that I&#39;m incredibly lazy and DUST is really fun :P)<br /><br /><br />[color=orange][size=4] Install/Uninstall[/size][/color]<br /><br />[color=orange][size=3] To Install[/size][/color]<br /><br />Install via NMM or unzip 7z to Fallout New Vegas Data folder.<br /><br />[color=orange][size=3] To Uninstall[/size][/color]<br /><br />Remove via NMM or delete esp from Fallout New Vegas Data folder.<br /><br /><br />[color=orange][size=4] Compatibility [/size][/color]<br />[s]<br />I have been notified that this mod is incompatible with [url={http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/45739/?}]Roleplayers Alternate Start[/url].[/s] *Disregard this, it is compatible.<br /><br />This mod is also incompatible with any mod that modifies the scripts VEnding and FadeToTimer.<br /><br /><br />[color=orange][size=4] Permissions [/size][/color]<br /><br />1.You may link this mod in a Forum or on a site like Youtube.<br />2.You may upload this mod to a another file hosting site (e.g planetfallout) but as long as I have   <br />   credit as the mod author.<br />3.You may use this mod in your own mod as you wish, it is a free resource for anyone to use.

Cabot&#39;s Quest 1.4.0
====================================================
By Ea6t for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[b]DESCRIPTION[/b]
<br />Cabot’s Quest! is a sizeable questline involving the Courier’s assistance in Bostonian scientist John Cabot’s search for evidence of ancient alien civilization in the Mojave Wasteland. Arrived in a prototype time machine from the year 2076, Cabot requires assistance to navigate the hostile new environment, construct a vital instrument, and confront whatever he discovers.
<br />
<br />The mod includes a series of rich dungeons filled with unique opponents, subtle stories, and, importantly, no shortage of loot for the enterprising prospector! The traversal of these locations should provide a suitable challenge for players between the levels of 15 and 25. But beyond the scope of combat, players will find a handful of storied characters pursuing their own ambitions and holding their fair share of grudges. The particularly perceptive may even trace the intertwining elements of the mod’s subplots back to their troubling source.
<br />
<br />The entirety of the mod should take around 3-5 hours to complete.

Campfires Expanded 1.4.0
====================================================
By elguapo1991 for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[b]Campfires Expanded[/b]
<br />
<br />This mod adds a new script to all campfires scattered throughout the game. Originally, you could only cook at a campfire (or sleep if you have the right perk), but I thought you should be able to do more than that.
<br />
<br />This should give players a more fun, useful, and immersive campfire experience in Fallout: New Vegas.
<br />
<br />
<br />[b]List of Actions[/b]
<br />
<br />[list]
<br />[*][b]Use Stimpak[/b] - If you have a Medicine skill of 15 or greater, and at least one Stimpak in your inventory, you can use one to fully heal yourself.
<br />[*][b]Use Doctor's Bag[/b] -  If you have a Medicine skill of 25 or greater, and at least one Doctor's Bag in your inventory, you can use one to fully restore all your limbs.
<br />[*][b]Use RadAway[/b] -  If you have a Medicine skill of 25 or greater, and at least one bag of RadAway in your inventory, you can use one to remove all radiation.
<br />[*][b]Cook Something[/b] -  Opens up the cooking menu. Player must have either a Pot, Metal Cooking Pot, or Metal Cooking Pan in their inventory to cook.
<br />[*][b]Purify Water[/b] - If you have a Survival skill of 50 or greater, and a Water Purifier in your inventory, you can purify all Irradiated or Dirty water in your inventory. Water Purifiers are reusable and are crafted at a Workbench.
<br />[*][b]Craft Items[/b] -  If you have a Repair skill of 50 or greater, and a Portable Workbench in your inventory, selecting this will open up the Workbench menu. Portable Workbenches are reusable and are crafted at a normal Workbench.
<br />[*][b]Craft Ammo[/b] -  If you have a Repair skill of 50 or greater, and a Portable Workbench in your inventory, selecting this will open up the Reloading Bench menu. Portable Workbenches are reusable and are crafted at a normal Workbench.
<br />[*][b]Sleep[/b] -  Allows you to sleep if you have the Home on the Range perk, from the Honest Hearts DLC. (You just need 70 survival skill in the No DLC version).
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />
<br />[b]Other Features[/b]
<br />
<br />[list]
<br />[*]Campfires in Goodsprings (across from the General Store, by the two large crates) and Novac (outside the dining tent).
<br />[*]New perk: Burning Man, available at Level 8 with 35 Survival. With this perk, just being near a Campfire will slowly increase your health, as well as boost your Perception and Survival.
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />
<br />[b]Installation[/b]
<br />
<br />Use the Nexus Mod Manager, or extract the Data folder to your  ...&#92;Fallout New Vegas&#92; directory.  Please select only one .esp in your load order after installation (normal or No DLC).
<br />
<br />As for load order, as long as the .esp is below any other mods that have to do with campfires, you should be fine.
<br />
<br />
<br />[b]Version History[/b]
<br />
<br />[list]
<br />[*]1.4 - Fixed a small bug that sometimes prevented the Burning Man actor effect from activating properly.
<br />[*]1.3 - Doubled the range that the Burning Man perk activates at, as well as added a 2-second message whenever you enter or leave that radius (which can alert you to a campfire you might otherwise have missed). Sleep option is hidden completely until you get the required perk (still always visible in No DLC version). Created and added custom icons for water purifier and portable workbench. Moved "Exit" button to top of list. A Metal Cooking Pan will now also fulfill the requirement for being able to cook. Fixed a bug with the script that gave you the notes/messages when you create your first workbench or purifier.
<br />[*]1.2 - Added Burning Man perk. Added pot requirement to cooking option. Increased weight of Portable Workbench. Added Water Purification option. Added campfire to Novac. Various spelling/wording changes.
<br />[*]1.1 - Fixed master file issue. Included alternate .esp for those without the Honest Hearts DLC. In this version, you just need a survival skill of 70 to sleep at a campfire, instead of the Home on the Range perk. Only choose one .esp after installation. Also fixed a spelling error in the main menu ("stimpack" to "stimpak").
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />
<br />[b]Requirements[/b]
<br />
<br />[list]
<br />[*]Normal version requires the Honest Hearts DLC. If you do not have Honest Hearts, use the No DLC .esp.
<br />[*]Does NOT need NVSE (yet).
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />
<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]
<br />
<br />[list]
<br />[*]The mod [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/42056]Burning Campfire[/url] will not work with this mod, as it uses an altered version of the original script for campfires. I may try to release a version of this with that mod incorporated into it, in the future (with the author's permission of course).
<br />[*]It may conflict with any mods that alter which script the vanilla campfires use. The original script for campfires was left untouched, so it should still work fine for anything that needs to use it (hotplates, etc).
<br />[*]Mods that add NEW campfire objects (i.e. new user-created activators set to use the original campfire script) will not be affected or changed by this mod. This is because this mod alters the vanilla/Honest Hearts campfires only.
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />
<br />[b]Known Issues/Bugs[/b]
<br />
<br />[list]
<br />[*]If you are close enough to more than one campfire at a time, the Burning Man perk effect may be cancelled out, along with the messages doing odd things (appearing twice, not appearing at all, etc).
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />
<br />[b]Misc. Notes[/b]
<br />
<br />[list]
<br />[*]Campfires cannot be used in combat, like usual.
<br />[*]Interacting with the campfire will autosave your game (unless you are in combat).
<br />[*]Recipe for a Portable Workbench is: 2x Wrench, 1x Hammer, 2x Scrap Electronics, 5x Scrap Metal, 2x Duct Tape, 2x WonderGlue, 1x Leather Belt, 1x Lunchbox, 1x Abraxo Cleaner, 1x Turpentine, and 1x Paint Gun. The recipe will not show up if you already have one in your inventory.
<br />[*]Recipe for a Water Purifier is: 1x Pot, 1x Surgical Tubing, 1x WonderGlue, 1x Coffee Kettle. The recipe will not show up if you already have one in your inventory.
<br />[*]Thanks to user [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/users/2754974]TheAmazingPixel[/url] for the Water Purification idea!
<br />[*]Please let me know of any bugs or compatibility issues! Also, suggestions are welcome!

Casino Crowds 1.0.0
====================================================
By BlooperReel for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[center][color=#b6d7a8][size=6]CASINO CROWDS[/size][/color]
<br />[quote][i][size=3]"There's not as many people playing at Gomorrah, so that means I've got better odds of winning big. I got this figured out."
<br />[/size][size=3]Little Buster, 2239-2281[/size][/i][/quote][/center]
<br />[code][size=3]Populated Casinos is a good idea on paper, but it has several issues; multiple dirty edits and a general lack of polish leading to a lot of performance drops and general game stability problems. It also just adds far too many NPCs in general. [/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Casino Crowds is designed as a modern - and hopefully lightweight - alternative. Double the amount of npcs compared to vanilla, but not nearly to the ludicrous numbers of npcs added in Populated Casinos. [/size]
<br />[/code]
<br />
<br />[color=#93c47d][size=5][center]FEATURES:[/center][/size][/color][center][size=4][/size][/center][left][size=4][/size][/left][center]﻿[/center][center][size=4][/size][/center][code][center][size=4]- Increased NPC population in all 3 Casinos:
<br />[/size][color=#f6b26b][size=3]80+ across Gomorrah 
<br />[/size][/color][color=#c27ba0][size=3]55+ across The Tops
<br />[/size][/color]﻿[color=#a4c2f4][size=3]15+ in The Ultra-Luxe [/size][/color][/center][center][size=4]- Designed for maximum compatibility with other mods!
<br />[/size]- [size=3]Lively new NPCs with varied (and some previously unused) animations![/size][/center][center][size=3]- Minor adjustments to existing NPC packages and positions to feel more polished. [/size][/center][/code][center][size=3][/size][/center][center][size=3][/size][/center][center][size=3][/size]
<br />[size=5]
<br />[color=#93c47d]THE DETAILS:
<br />
<br />[/color][/size][size=2][/size][/center][left][code]﻿[size=2] - This mod has been personally tested on max settings with vanilla textures and no ENB. I can't speak for potential performance drops when used alongside texture mods/ENB but testing on other machines has reported mostly smooth framerates. Thanks to TheHermit, ElPascal, DanteFettman and Smiss for testing! 
<br />[/size]
<br />[size=2] - Fully compatible with all languages!
<br />[/size] 
<br />[size=2] - NPCs are clustered with some degree of awareness for both performance and general context. There aren't massive crowds of gamblers tied to every slot machine and seat in the cell, but there'll still be a significant number. 
<br />[/size]
<br />[size=2] - Gomorrah canonically has fewer gamblers playing the games, so their casino floor isn't nearly as populated as their other attractions.  
<br />[/size]
<br />[size=2] - NPC additions to the Ultra-Luxe have only been made to the Casino Floor; all other cells have had their populations untouched. The expensive atmosphere keeps the riff-raff out. 
<br />[/size]
<br />[size=2] - This mod does NOT add NPCs to the Vikki And Vance or the Atomic Wrangler. 
<br />[/size]
<br />[size=2]  - Load this mod under mods such as Uncut Wasteland or other content restoration mods that restore disabled gambler npcs for full compatibility; I've kept many of those npcs disabled so I can use my own npcs in their place. 
<br />[/size]
<br />[size=2] - Most new NPCs are Gamblers, with some exceptions; several new generic prostitutes and Omertas have been added. One new dealer has also been added to The Tops to fill an empty table. 
<br />[/size]
<br />[size=2] - Compatible with Depths Of Depravity, which uses one of the tables in Tops Restaurant for its quest NPCs. 
<br />[/size] 
<br />[size=2] - Reccomended to use alongside Prerelease Restored, which restores several cut dancers to Gomorrah. 
<br />[/size]
<br />[size=2] - Gamblers in different casinos use different animations! Gamblers in Gomorrah act loud and excitable, Ultra-Luxe gamblers are more reserved and somewhat nervous. Also restores several unused animations! 
<br />[/size]
<br />[size=2] - Edits have been made to the AI packages used by generic Chairmen to allow them to idle more realistically, as opposed to wandering like headless chickens.
<br />[/size]
<br />[size=2] - Not compatible with Populated Casinos.  
<br />[/size]
<br />[size=2] - A separate addon for more unique random encounters within the casino (In the style of the ones on The Strip) will be made at some point in the future! Feel free to send me suggestions for potential scenarios. [/size]

<br />
<br />Notes -
<br />[list]
<br />[*]If the mod is too 'shiny' in game with your visual setup, try deleting the _n file.

<br />[*]Choose from - [b]Rainbow Soft/Sharp, Arctic, Midnight, Lime, Violet, Pineapple, Sunny[/b], [b]Dragonfruit [/b]and [b]Dread[/b] (if you dare).

Classic Sniper FO4 1.3.0

====================================================

[size=3][color=#ff7700][size=3][b][center][font=Courier New][size=6][i]D.K.S. Classic Sniper Rifle[/i]

<br />[/size][/font][/center][font=Courier New][size=4]Preface[/size][/font][/b][/size][/color][font=Courier New][size=4]   ﻿[/size]
<br />
<br />- With permission, I have ported LtCommander's excellent DKS-501 models from Fallout 4 to Fallout New Vegas.      ﻿
<br />
<br />- You can find his original mod here: [/font][/size][font=Courier New][size=3]https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15909[/size][/font][font=Courier New]
<br />[color=#ff7700]
<br />[size=4][b]Description[/b][/size][/color][size=3][size=4]   ﻿[/size]
<br />
<br />- All vanilla variants of the Sniper Rifle have been replaced with LtCommander's models. 
<br />
<br />- This includes the Sniper Rifle with both mods, the Gobi Scout Rifle and Christine's COS Silencer Rifle. 
<br />
<br />[/size][size=3]- Requires OWB as the plugin edits the COS rifle.   ﻿
<br />
<br />- This is my first released project so all critique and advice is certainly welcome.
<br />[size=4]   [/size][/size][size=4]
<br />[/size][size=3][b][color=#ff7700][size=4]Bugs/Compatibility 
<br />
<br />[/size][/color][/b]- Compatibility patches for Asurah's Animations are available under Optional Files
<br />
<br />- Compatibility patches for WMX are available under Main Files
<br />
<br />- Compatibility patch for TTW is available under Main Files[b]
<br />
<br />- [/b]NPCs and Companions may not use the correct model for modified weapons. All files should contain, or will soon be updated to contain, static entries for the weapon models which will help somewhat with this issue
<br />
<br />- However, the JIP LN Plugin versions 55.45+ contains an engine fix that is more reliable and functional than the vanilla implementation for NPCs using modified weapons. 
<br />   ﻿
<br />   ﻿It can be found here:

<br />[/size]
<br />- The lighting properties of this mod were made with KiCH666's shader tweak in mind, your mileage may very with other set ups
<br />
<br />   ﻿KiCH666's fixed version of Millenia's shader tweak:
<br />
<br />   ﻿   ﻿https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69135

<br />COLORIZED SECURITRONS[/b][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[size=4]All securitrons are colorized including [b]Marylin[/b] (cut from the game), [b]Yes Man[/b] on giant screens (e.g. Lucky 38, Hoover Dam) and Old World Blues securitrons such as [b]Muggy[/b].
<br />[/size]
<br />[color=#ff0000][b][size=4]This mod does not require [color=#cfe2f3]Old World Blues[/color] to work since there is no ESP.[/size][/b][/color]

Companion Voices 0.0.0-
====================================================
By Quetzlsacatanango for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

This mod simply allows you to go back to DLC locations and retrieve your followers, who will now follow you like any other vanilla companion.

Now with Ulysses from Lonesome Road-
If you resolved things peacefully with Ulysses, you will find him at the vista, just inside the Canyon Wreckage overlooking The Divide.
I left his ugly mask on, but made it playable, so if you think it\'s awful like I do, you can remove it. I gave him a somewhat similar \"true\" face, and a wig of his regular hairstyle.
Has not been exhaustively tested but seems to work well enough. 
He will still have all of the regular post-quest dialog that the non-follower has, some of it, like asking why he is \"here\", or asking about stuff he found in the Courier\'s Mile, are only available when he is un-hired.
No voices, it is too much of a PITA. If someone else wants to do it I will be happy to give you instructions.
The only difference between 1.0 and 1.1 is that 1.1 has a mastered esp, so that he will actually be black (vanilla problem with NPCs added by plugins).
Please report issues in the comments.

Thanks to Mahare for providing voices for Dean and Waking Cloud. They are available under optional files. Give him kudos.

DM 1.5 - Adds Dean Domino as a re-recruitable companion. Go back to his apartment to pick him up.
Christine can be found in her Sierra Madre suite.
You will need to go get her before you leave, or else you\'ll need a mod to allow you to return to Sierra Madre.
Various bug fixes

HH 1.4 - Adds L38 functionality to Waking Cloud and JG. 

Waking Cloud
Full Burned Man Race
Burned Man voices

Joshua Graham can be found in Angel Cave, possibly cleaning his guns.
You need to re-enter Zion or at least walk around the reward chest to enable him.

He will give his \'way of the caananite\' perk. 
No perk for Christine, it doesn\'t make sense without the collar.

Feel free to use these files as a base for your own companion expansion mods.

Requirements:
Christine requires Dead Money DLC
Joshua Graham requires Honest Hearts DLC *and* \"Authentic Burned Man\" by RocketLombax (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41974)

Installation:
Extract contents to New Vegas\\Data directory

Credits:
Bethesda
Obsidian
Rocketlombax for Authentic Burned Man
Mahare for providing Dean/Waking Cloud voices

Use as you please as long as you credit those above.

<br />[/size][/color][/color][/color][/b][/color][/font][/center][left][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=4][b]This is a total texture overhaul to over 3600+ icons. This mod includes all Icons seen in Fallout New Vegas and its DLC's, Fallout 3 and its DLC's, but also icons from 65+ different kinds of mods. Most of these icons have been resized (since they were unusual big or small) and correctly aligned. Many of these icons had unwanted backgrounds, noise, issues related to compression and other oddities like being inconsistent in coloration and transparency...This is all fixed! If you don't like a certain Icon, I've added many alternatives to suit your taste! With the optional included plugin made by the amazing Miguick, hundreds of remastered icons will be added to your game without necessarily replacing anything. The plugin works as a .ini module, so it's easily customizable! There is also many new additional details to most of the icons! See if you can spot them! [/b]
<br />
<br />[b]What is also included in this mod is Modders Resources, icons found here you can use these icons as you like (even make a mod out of it!) - all I want in return is "Thank You" and acknowledgement over my hard work. If you still need resources, I've added the source files for these icons and a guide on how to compile them as a functional Icons.[/b]
<br />
<br />
<br />[b]What other things have I done? I try really hard to not think about it, but not a moment goes by where it doesn't cross my mind. The man I was before, he is dead now. I don't even know who I am anymore. Sometimes I can't sleep because it's on my mind, just eating me away into this shallow and awful human being. I ask myself, can I continue on like this? Is it even worth it? Can I keep telling myself these lies after lies to hold my sanity? I guess I am afraid of changing, because I've had no control over the changes that have happened around me, but what has changed is these sweet ass looking icons. Take a look![/b][/size][/font]

<br />A: Before bothering me, make sure: you are using UI that supports scaling, such as DarnUI or Vanilla UI+ [i][color=#00ff00][size=4](and the latest version of it)[/size][/color][/i]. If you are using the plugin, make sure to have latest [/size][i][size=4][color=#00ff00][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277]JIP LN NVSE Plugin[/url]﻿ and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66927]Johnny Guitar NVSE[/url]﻿. Also make sure that this mod is loaded/installed last. If you are using Hud Editor, make sure it's on the latest version and try loading that last.[/color][/size][/i]

<br />[size=5][center][size=6][font=Comic Sans MS]Placed Creature Corpses use Vanilla Skeletons.[/font][/size][/center][/size] This mod is very simple, makes the placed corpses use vanilla skeletons. That's it. Why? Because if placed corpses use skeletons from other mods, they most likely look like Quagmire from family guy.  You can go home now. I have nothing else to say. Stop reading. Well, now that I got your attention, have you heard of our Lord and Savior Jesus? He is the guy who picks up the vegetables in your local farm. His job matters, and if it weren't for him, you wouldn't have eaten that one salad that you ate three months ago. So, show some god damn respect. Still here? You are probably the only guy who has read this far, that's cool. Yeah, I said "the only guy", because most likely, you are a guy. Anyways hows your sex life? Things are doopedy doops. Bill Cosby gets it. Here is some text that has no purpose, just like us when it comes to our place in the universe. Bon Appetit!

As a result, exposed skin is a little light and doesn&#39;t quite match Danny&#39;s face.

Daughters of Ares - 2-2-0 2.2.0
====================================================
By lucasjose501 for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

This is an re-upload.
<br />
<br />[b]January 18th, 2021.[/b]
<br />
<br />A little bit of explanation:
<br />A few years ago, my crazy ex that though this mod would "impact" our relationship deleted this mod from nexus and got my account closed and my email account also. Now, I got it back! And as respect with the community and specially [b]DizzasterJuice [/b]and [b]Eiries[/b], I'm uploading it again.
<br />I know the time has passed, there might not be many players, but at least this file will be here.
<br />
<br />I didn't have player New Vegas since 2016, and I'm not updated with the latest changes in the Nexus ecosystem, but I'll take a time from work soon to see what can I do to improve it.
<br />
<br />I'll upload the original files as I remember and paste the description here.
<br />Any changes will come soon, but at least this is a start.

Daughters of Ares - Fix 2-2-1 2.2.1
====================================================
By lucasjose501 for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

This is an re-upload.
<br />
<br />[b]January 18th, 2021.[/b]
<br />
<br />A little bit of explanation:
<br />A few years ago, my crazy ex that though this mod would "impact" our relationship deleted this mod from nexus and got my account closed and my email account also. Now, I got it back! And as respect with the community and specially [b]DizzasterJuice [/b]and [b]Eiries[/b], I'm uploading it again.
<br />I know the time has passed, there might not be many players, but at least this file will be here.
<br />
<br />I didn't have player New Vegas since 2016, and I'm not updated with the latest changes in the Nexus ecosystem, but I'll take a time from work soon to see what can I do to improve it.
<br />
<br />I'll upload the original files as I remember and paste the description here.
<br />Any changes will come soon, but at least this is a start.

Dead Money Followers 1.6.0
====================================================
By Quetzlsacatanango for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

This mod simply allows you to go back to DLC locations and retrieve your followers, who will now follow you like any other vanilla companion.

Now with Ulysses from Lonesome Road-
If you resolved things peacefully with Ulysses, you will find him at the vista, just inside the Canyon Wreckage overlooking The Divide.
I left his ugly mask on, but made it playable, so if you think it\'s awful like I do, you can remove it. I gave him a somewhat similar \"true\" face, and a wig of his regular hairstyle.
Has not been exhaustively tested but seems to work well enough. 
He will still have all of the regular post-quest dialog that the non-follower has, some of it, like asking why he is \"here\", or asking about stuff he found in the Courier\'s Mile, are only available when he is un-hired.
No voices, it is too much of a PITA. If someone else wants to do it I will be happy to give you instructions.
The only difference between 1.0 and 1.1 is that 1.1 has a mastered esp, so that he will actually be black (vanilla problem with NPCs added by plugins).
Please report issues in the comments.

Thanks to Mahare for providing voices for Dean and Waking Cloud. They are available under optional files. Give him kudos.

DM 1.5 - Adds Dean Domino as a re-recruitable companion. Go back to his apartment to pick him up.
Christine can be found in her Sierra Madre suite.
You will need to go get her before you leave, or else you\'ll need a mod to allow you to return to Sierra Madre.
Various bug fixes

HH 1.4 - Adds L38 functionality to Waking Cloud and JG. 

Waking Cloud
Full Burned Man Race
Burned Man voices

Joshua Graham can be found in Angel Cave, possibly cleaning his guns.
You need to re-enter Zion or at least walk around the reward chest to enable him.

He will give his \'way of the caananite\' perk. 
No perk for Christine, it doesn\'t make sense without the collar.

Feel free to use these files as a base for your own companion expansion mods.

Requirements:
Christine requires Dead Money DLC
Joshua Graham requires Honest Hearts DLC *and* \"Authentic Burned Man\" by RocketLombax (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41974)

Installation:
Extract contents to New Vegas\\Data directory

Credits:
Bethesda
Obsidian
Rocketlombax for Authentic Burned Man
Mahare for providing Dean/Waking Cloud voices
Myself
Use as you please as long as you credit those above.

Deathclaw Mutants 1.1.0
====================================================
By Kry11ic for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

WHAT DOES THIS DO?:
Well, simple. This adds 5 large Deathclaws throughout the Mojave for you to battle and loot some items off of. This isn\'t something special, just a simple mod that adds these enemies. But, I do have plans for this creature for one of my future mods.

Deathclaw Mutant:
Each Deathclaw Mutant has different stats, attack damage, health, and DT. So, taking different approaches may have different results of the battle. (let me know if you guys think I need to change any of the traits or attack damage or any of those to really get the feel that each one is a different, but still difficult battle. And thanks to dralgon23 for giving me the idea for different types of Deathclaws attributes).

LOCATION:
There are 5 of these beasts around the Mojave. I think part of the fun about fighting these monsters is finding them.

INSTALLATION:
Simply drap and drop the .esp file into your Games/FalloutNewVegas/Data folder. Then when you start up the game, go to your Data Files and check off the Deathclaw Mutant mod.

FUTURE MOD:
I\'m currently working on another mod for all of you to experience. I don\'t want to go into too much detail, I want to kind of surprise you guys. But, I will have a Beta for you guys, featuring the first 5 levels, including a boss at the end. But, this deathclaw isn\'t going to be in the final mod, let alone the Beta. This deathclaw, although, will be the same size, but it will have many different and new features, but will only be in the final mod, not in the Beta. 
I\'m almost done with the Beta, I only have about 2 more levels left, and then add on the enemies and then I should be done, so I hope you guys look forward to it!

Delilah Alternative Voice Pack 1.0.0
====================================================
By tostikaas for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/50641/]Delilah - Mojave MD[/url] is a fantastic companion mod, but the original voice recordings are lacking in quality. This mod replaces all of Delilah&#39;s lines with new recordings by another voice actress with good equipment in a soundproof environment.<br /><br />I&#39;m not claiming this is the perfect voice overhaul. The voice is very different from the original and might not be for everybody. If you prefer the original acting by all means stick with it. The main goal was to provide a high quality voice for Delilah that smoothly blends in with other in-game sounds for a more immersive experience.<br /><br />[b]Install[/b]<br />Use NMM/FOMM or extract to data folder to overwrite the original files. This pack was made for version 1.7 (august 22, 2013). Should an update come out with drastic dialog changes such as new lines it obviously won&#39;t be supported, but I think it&#39;s safe to say that this is the final version of the mod.

DelilahMMD1v7FULL 1.7.0
====================================================
By scrumpusrex for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[img]http://i40.tinypic.com/2r41zcx.png[/IMG]



DELILAH NOW HAS A NEW FACE AND REMASTERED AUDIO! DOWNLOAD THIS UPDATE IF YOU\'RE PLAYING WITH DELILAH NOW!!

[img]http://i42.tinypic.com/6t08pf.png[/IMG]

Delilah is a fully scripted, synched and voiced, lore-friendly female medical companion for New Vegas. She has a fully functional companion wheel.

Her textures, meshes, and hair are completely self-contained requiring no additional mods. [credits given below]

Delilah was raised in Goodsprings and has lived there all her life. She lived with her father and his tribal bodyguard, Sulik until their deaths.
She is Doc Mitchell\'s nurse, and has an aptitude for medicine. She has recently begun thinking of adventure, and helping Doc Mitchell with the
wounded stranger in town seems to her like it might be her ticket out..

Can you help Delilah achieve her goals of becoming a legitimate Mojave MD and finding her true calling?

- Over 300 lines of fully voice acted/lip synched unique dialogue
- Unique Tattooed Body Type (ALICE T3)
- 3 Marked Quests leading Delilah along the path of becoming a Mojave doctor
- And unmarked quest included just for fun (but not without it\'s rewards!)
- 3 new perks Delilah gives you over the course of your travels
- 4 unique new Aid items taught to Delilah by her \"Uncle\" Sulik [craftable through dialogue]
- Learns ACTUAL DOCTOR ABILITIES as your companion!! (ie; heal health & limbs, cure addictions, remove poison, & remove radiation)
- 2 fully-functioning menus (combat menu & medical) usable in and out of combat
- Essential and Weapon Alert toggles [in dialogue]
- Affected by the Ferocious Loyalty perk
- Scripted to use Stimpaks/SuperStimpaks, Antivenom, & Med-X at appropriate times in and out of combat (ie; after critical hits, when health gets low, etc)

Delilah is located in the house next to Chet\'s store in Goodsprings.

This is my first ever mod of anything, so any feedback is much appreciated. Bug reports I will give my attention to ASAP, but
hopefully there are none. Enjoy!

[img]http://i42.tinypic.com/2dqbra.png[/IMG]

Just extract the archive in the your [ C:\\..FalloutNewVegas\\data\\ ] folder, then activate Delilah.esp in your FOMM or NMM.

[img]http://i42.tinypic.com/2m6v1ar.png[/IMG]

Sometimes Delilah can have dialogue disappear. If you encounter this please PM me if you discover one.

Download and distribute. Just give credit where credit is due.
PS: reverse engineering is a great way to learn.

EDE_Advanced_1_1 1.1.0
====================================================
By Roy Batty for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[center][color=#9fc5e8]<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/xDxkobJ.png[/img]<br /><br />ED-E upgraded is a small mod I made as a test of adding perks to companions.<br /><br />This mod gives ED-E the Light Step perk. It also gives ED-E both upgrades no matter if you choose to bring him to The Brotherhood of Steel or The Followers of the Apocalypse. I like ED-E&#39;s iconic default appearance, so he keeps that after receiving the upgrades. ED-E has been given his melee weapons in both normal and upgraded forms which was also a bug. In upgraded form the buzzing from his upgraded Zap Gun has been removed as I believe it was a bug.<br /><br />I recommend that the mod be added to your merged or bashed patch to cut down on your load order.<br /><br />There are other mods doing some of these things, but none of them worked for me and only provided visuals and not the actual upgrades. This mod is tested and working and shouldn&#39;t cause any problems. It will conflict with other mods that edit ED-E, but is easily merged with them.<br /><br />Change Log:<br /><br />1.0 - Initial Release<br />1.1 - ED-E now retains default appearance when upgraded. Script updated to stop the start-up quest from always running. Stun Batons added to ED-E&#39;s inventory. Upgraded Weapon idle noise removed.[/color][/center]

No Locations 1.0.0
====================================================
By Dudeman325 for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

Requested by jvanderr

Changes the Explorer perk to increase movement speed by 5% and add +4DT, regardless of armor worn (or not worn!). There are two versions to choose from depending on whether or not you want the perk to unlock unexplored locations as normal. This mod is mostly intended for veteran players who have trouble finding high-level perks to choose, and already know their way around the Wasteland fairly well.

This mod has no DLC or mod dependencies.

This mod is not compatible with other mods that change the Explorer Perk, unless they only change the quest that unlocks locations without touching the perk entry. Loading this mod after other mods that affect Explorer will allow its changes to be applied instead.

FNVModLimitFix 2.5.0
====================================================
By iranrmrf for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[center][font=Verdana][color=#ff8f00][size=5]﻿﻿[u]Installation[/u][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[color=#c9daf8][u]You will need NVSE for this plugin to work.[/u] Simply overwrite your data folder with the folder in the zip file. It does work with MO2. An ini file will be generated upon running the game for the first time in the plugins folder. In the ini file one can edit the maximum allowed handles or enable logging. Do not edit this if the fix works. It will not increase performance by lowering the maximum allowed file handles and there is absolutely no point in increasing it. The logging is there for when issues arise. If you would like to experiment, go ahead, just don't leave debugging on as it writes to a text file very often.
<br />[/color]
<br />
<br />[color=#ff8f00][size=5][u]Conflicts[/u][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[color=#c9daf8]This fix should have no conflicts whatsoever. A mod limit message might appear. It will happen if you use JIP's Companions Command and Control mod. There is nothing I can do about the message for now. When the mod author returns from his busy schedule I will let him know about what has happened and I'm certain he will patch it. It in no way means that the plugin does not work or that the limit still exists.
<br />[/color]
<br />
<br />[color=#ff8f00][size=5][u]Why the Limit Existed[/u][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[color=#c9daf8]The plugin limit bug existed because the game opens 3 file handles for each plugin and never seems to close them. The reason as to why it does this is still unknown. The game has a hard coded limit of 512 maximum file handles that can be opened at once. When loading anywhere around 140 plugins, the game requires around 420 handles for these alone. Along with bsa files as well as normal files the game requires, the game would easily attempt to open more than 512 handles. This is the reason assets stopped loading and things would begin to go south.
<br />[/color]
<br />
<br />[color=#ff8f00][size=5][u]How this Fix Works[/u][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[color=#c9daf8] This fix simply bumps the maximum number of file handles up to 2048. The reason that 2048 is used is because it is the maximum number of file handles that Windows usually allows, and the more the merrier. The fix also redesigns the way the game obtains file handles. Due to the file handles not closing, the game would have iterate over all of the loaded plugin handles in order to open a new one. This fix changes this and allows for file handles to be opened instantly.
<br />[/color]
<br />
<br />[color=#ff8f00][size=5][u]Performance Boost[/u][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[color=#c9daf8]The increase in fps, stutter removal and decreased loading times seems to affect everyone to a different extent. This mod can only have positive performance benefits and will in no way affect any of the game's content. The only way to know if it will benefit you is to download it and try it for yourself.
<br />[/color]

Family Matters Fixed 1.1.0
====================================================
By Nazothedark for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

In the El-Rey Motel, there lives an old man named Austin. Austin is stricken with cancer and is not long for this world. Though he has many regrets, his greatest shame was that he never apologized to those he hurt the most: his family. Through you, he may just get a chance to correct this mistake.
<br />
<br />I'm back with another mod that should've been released at least a year ago. You know the drill the Frontier and school ate up all my time (excuses I know). Unlike New Vegas Stories, the quests in this mod are all connected to an overarching story, that being the tragic tale of Austin and his family. The quests involve areas both new and old, including a new bar in Fiend territory called Off-Beat and a three level dungeon. The quests probably won't take you too long to finish, but I do hope you have fun while playing them. ^-^
<br />
<br />To start the first quest (and through it all the other quests) speak to Austin in his room at the El-Rey Motel. He can be found on the upper level.
<br />
<br />A big thanks to all the voice actors that lent their talents to the mod:

no combat condition 0.0.0-
====================================================
By Shantih for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

Updates
=======

An optional version has been uploaded. This version makes Fiends Friendly even in combat. As long as you wear a Fiend Helmet they will be on your side (whatever side that may be). Simply remove the helmet to get rid of the effect.

Description
===========

Based on the Infiltrations mod for Fallout 3, a modification for players who want to mingle with Fiends. Warning: engaging combat will blow your cover...

After you\'ve engaged combat you will be considered hostile as long as you are not \"hidden\" from enemies, then all you have to do is to unequip the helmet and put it back on to be able to mingle with your foes once again.

If you kill somebody before they even retaliate this won\'t be considered as entering combat so this will not blow your cover (the foe has to survive and attack you to set the alarm). 

Install
=======

1. Extract this archive to any folder and then copy the esp to the Data.
folder.
2. Start Fallout NV Launcher, click Data Files, and enable the .esp file.

Uninstall
=========

1. Start Fallout NV Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file.
2. Delete the esp file.

Compatibility
===============

It should be compatible with any mod that do not modify Fiend Helmets.


I\'ve already mentioned the fact that if you kill a friendly foe outright you won\'t set the alarm and the bystanders won\'t be hostile.

Wounding a foe will blow the cover since the condition will trigger when the foe retaliates.

If you want to blow your cover you can remove the headgear, that will make foes hostile thus triggering the mines you may have placed near your foes.

Only Helmets are taken into account but if you don\'t want to break immersion wear a Raider Armor with your Fiend Helmet!


PRECISION: it works with followers, only the Player character matters but for better immersion you can always dress up your followers.


Known Issues or Bugs
====================

NOT A BUG: if you run into Fiends while wearing a Fiend helmet and they are hostile it is most certainly because you are already in combat (check if there is a creature attacking you). Being in combat will blow your cover (it is meant to be that way).


Credits
=======

Thanks to Obsidian and Bethesda for keeping Fallout alive and thanks to the TESNexus for being so awesome.

===============

Last but not least, don\'t forget to leave a comment or a rating if you liked this little mod.

Have a nice game! ;)

GamblingAddict - with Deadmoney 1.0.0
====================================================
By mdg for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

Essentially what this mod does is raises ALL of the casinos MAX bet and MAX cap. This mod also allows for longer gambling as well(which is the whole point). And being banned in casinos should also be slowed down quite a bit by this.  So here's the rundown for everything this mod consists of.
<br />

gomorrah_girls only 1.0.0
====================================================
By swordclash117 for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

This mod changes all the generic dancers inside Gomorrah and its courtyard to be women (no ghouls!) and use the sexy sleepwear item instead of the prostitute outfit. Yes, even the bartenders
<br />
<br />This also changes the hookers outside the casino, Joana, and Dazzle. They all use the sexy sleepwear item now.
<br />
<br />I strongly recommend using my "[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/70606]Sexy sleepwear with high heels[/url]﻿" mod alongside this one for best effect

Heaven&#39;s Maria Retextured 3.0.0
====================================================
By Heaven3xx3 for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[center][font=Arial][color=#BF9000][size=6]﻿﻿﻿Heaven’s[/size][/color][/font][font=Arial][size=6] Maria Retextured[/size][/font][/center]
<br />[center]Now included in my pack [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69837]Weapon Textures from Heaven[/url]﻿﻿![/center][b]
<br />
<br />[/b][font=Arial][size=2]Maria is my most favorite gun design in all of FNV. I was disheartened when I found out that nobody had retextured it and kept it to the original gun's spirit, so I decided to take it upon myself. The gun didn't take much tears except for the normals, which i had to upscale with Gigapixel AI since doing such an elaborate engraving would have the retexture be released at 2050. Endorsements, comments and constructive criticism really encourage and help me. Suggestions for next weapon to retexture are also welcome![/size][/font]
<br />
<br />[font=Arial][color=#BF9000][size=3]Content[/size][/color][/font]
<br />
<br />[font=Arial][size=2]This is an HD 2k retexture of Maria, Our Lady of Guadalupe had been completely redone in HD and had been engraved like the original. The mod comes with 2k Diffuse and 1k Normals for the best balance between performance and visuals.[/size][/font]
<br />
<br />[font=Arial][color=#BF9000][size=3]Installation[/size][/color][/font]
<br />
<br />[font=Arial][size=2]Simply install with a mod manager (Mod Organizer 2 is highly recommended) or put files in Data folder of NV folder and overwrite/replace.[/size][/font]
<br />
<br />[font=Arial][color=#BF9000][size=3]Compatibility[/size][/color][/font]
<br />
<br />[font=Arial][size=2]This is a pure texture replacer without any esp so it shouldn’t cause any issues, just make sure to put it after other weapon retexture mods you’re using so that it doesn’t get overwritten. Compatible with WMIM/TTW &amp; WMX.[/size][/font]

Hidden Valley Overhauled Classic BoS Theme 1.0.0
====================================================
By Ludo for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[color=#FAFF50][font=Verdana][size=5][b]Overview [/b][/size][/font][/color]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Hidden Valley in vanilla New Vegas is a bit of a damp squib. There's this omnipresent dull warm lighting, hallways are bland and uncluttered, and some rooms are put together a bit clumsily.  Hidden Valley: Overhauled is a (mostly) visual rework of the Brotherhood of Steel's base. All alterations and additions are 100% lore-friendly and aim to fit seamlessly with the base game. The goal was to create something that could have been mistaken for Hidden Valley if it had gotten a bit more development work (and maybe the developers were more familiar with the assets!). This mod consciously doesn't alter the existing NavMesh at all which gives an idea of what it does and doesn't do.
<br />
<br />Fallout 3's Raven Rock and Hidden Valley in-universe are presumably of the same bunker design, but on a meta level they obviously share the same tileset. Closely studying how Bethesda made Raven Rock provided a lot of room for improvement; contrasting colours, volumetric glow, atmospheric smoke and steam, strong uplighting, dangling wires, beeping consoles etc. A look at the original Fallout's Lost Hills bunker also helped establish what a Brotherhood HQ should look like. This was followed by nice little touches that helped make the location more consistent and believable. All changes were carefully considered and implemented, and the screenshots above probably don't do the full package justice.
<br />
<br />Aside from aesthetic changes, this mod also re-enables a few cut NPCs and fleshes out the fusion reactor mentioned in terminal entries with a new hidden bonus area.[/size]
<br />
<br />[color=#FAFF50][font=Verdana][size=5][b]Install[/b][/size][/font][/color]
<br />
<br />[i][Although it has been tested a fair bit, best advice is to install the mod *before* entering the bunker for the first time. Also, probably a good idea to make sure any valuables aren't left in the bunker before you install][/i]
<br />
<br />1. Open your New Vegas install folder, then find and open the Data folder.
<br />2. Drag the contents of the .rar file into the Data folder.
<br />3. Start New Vegas. 
<br />

NVDLC02 Extension 2 BSA 2.0.0
====================================================
By Machienzo for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

Honest Hearts ends rather unexpectedly. Despite being an open map to begin with, it doesn't offer much after the main quest line. This mod hopes to change that, by adding extra things to do after the main quest has been completed. 
<br />
<br />Now, instead of curiously being given all the unique character's items from a magically appearing footlocker, you'll have to find those items in certain locations to encourage more travelling. Note that the unique Sorrows clothing has not been kept.
<br />
<br />The Zion Canyon Map will also add every unknown location to your map, just waiting for you to uncover.
<br />
<br />[b][i]New References!
<br />[/i][/b]Park Ranger Hat found near the Survivalist.
<br />
<br />[b][i]New Armor!
<br />[/i][/b]Park Ranger clothing found in several outposts!
<br />
<br />[b][i]New Weapon!
<br />[/i][/b].45 Compact can be bought from Joshua Graham and Gun Runners.
<br />.45 Pistol now will have Improved Sights mod.
<br />
<br />[b][i]New Recipe!
<br />[/i][/b]Fire Bomb - Workbench - 1 SS Bottle, 10 Flamer Fuel - 30 Explosives
<br />
<br />[b][i]Bugfixes!
<br />[/i][/b]Survivalist's Duffle Bag marked to prevent NPC stealing unique rifle.
<br />
<br />[b][i]Post-Ending Changes!
<br />[/i][/b]Rewards Footlocker REMOVED. Now Items will have to be scoured from certain locations throughout Zion, instead of being force-fed to the player. This will help keep the player interested in Zion.
<br />[list]
<br />[*]Daniel's items are found at the Sorrows Camp, near their fireplace.
<br />[*]Joshua's items are found on his table in Angel Cave.
<br />[*]Follows-Chalke's Hat is found next to the fireplace outside of Angel Cave.
<br />[*]Salt-Upon-Wound's Helmet is found on a totem at the end of Three Marys. 
<br />
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />[b][size=5]Installation[/size][/b]
<br />YOU NEED TO INSTALL Quetzlsacatanango's mod "Reunited And It Feels So Good" for Honest Hearts. You do not need to download the Authentic Burned Man mod however.
<br />http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=42087
<br />
<br />However, once that's installed, you then have to replace the ESP with the one provided here and make sure that the Extensions esp is loaded after the QHHFollowers.esp.

Honest Hearts Followers 1_4 1.4.0
====================================================
By Quetzlsacatanango for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

This mod simply allows you to go back to DLC locations and retrieve your followers, who will now follow you like any other vanilla companion.

Now with Ulysses from Lonesome Road-
If you resolved things peacefully with Ulysses, you will find him at the vista, just inside the Canyon Wreckage overlooking The Divide.
I left his ugly mask on, but made it playable, so if you think it\'s awful like I do, you can remove it. I gave him a somewhat similar \"true\" face, and a wig of his regular hairstyle.
Has not been exhaustively tested but seems to work well enough. 
He will still have all of the regular post-quest dialog that the non-follower has, some of it, like asking why he is \"here\", or asking about stuff he found in the Courier\'s Mile, are only available when he is un-hired.
No voices, it is too much of a PITA. If someone else wants to do it I will be happy to give you instructions.
The only difference between 1.0 and 1.1 is that 1.1 has a mastered esp, so that he will actually be black (vanilla problem with NPCs added by plugins).
Please report issues in the comments.

Thanks to Mahare for providing voices for Dean and Waking Cloud. They are available under optional files. Give him kudos.

DM 1.5 - Adds Dean Domino as a re-recruitable companion. Go back to his apartment to pick him up.
Christine can be found in her Sierra Madre suite.
You will need to go get her before you leave, or else you\'ll need a mod to allow you to return to Sierra Madre.
Various bug fixes

HH 1.4 - Adds L38 functionality to Waking Cloud and JG. 

Waking Cloud
Full Burned Man Race
Burned Man voices

Joshua Graham can be found in Angel Cave, possibly cleaning his guns.
You need to re-enter Zion or at least walk around the reward chest to enable him.

He will give his \'way of the caananite\' perk. 
No perk for Christine, it doesn\'t make sense without the collar.

Feel free to use these files as a base for your own companion expansion mods.

Requirements:
Christine requires Dead Money DLC
Joshua Graham requires Honest Hearts DLC *and* \"Authentic Burned Man\" by RocketLombax (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41974)

Installation:
Extract contents to New Vegas\\Data directory

Credits:
Bethesda
Obsidian
Rocketlombax for Authentic Burned Man
Mahare for providing Dean/Waking Cloud voices
Myself
Use as you please as long as you credit those above.

Honest Hearts Workbench Crate Luck 1.1.0
====================================================
By Asterra for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[color=#00ff00][size=6][b]Honest Hearts Workbench Crate Luck[/b][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[b][size=4][u]This mod forces the [i]Honest Hearts[/i] workbench crates to obey the player character's Luck.[/u][/size]
<br />
<br />
<br />[line]
<br />[size=3][color=#ff0000]v1.1:[/color][color=#ea9999] [/color][color=#b6d7a8]The crate which has a small chance of holding the only bottle of Nuka-Cola Quantum in the game will now also obey the player character's Luck.  (Lonesome Road is required.)[/color][/size]
<br />
<br />[/b][size=3]Do you recall how Luck plays a very tangible mechanical factor in winning at casinos?  Did you ever wonder why this didn't work with the far more important workbench crates?  This is the mod which finally fixes that.[/size]
<br />
<br />
<br />[size=3][u]Some background:[/u] Every major New Vegas DLC offers at least a dozen extra skill books.  [i]Honest Hearts[/i] is no exception -- it offers a whopping sixteen.  But for whatever reason, it was decided that all 16 books would be subject to a random number generator, rather than being a guaranteed reward for owning the DLC.  The books are hidden in four "storage crates" that are found throughout Zion Valley, but they will only appear if the random number generator says they will; the storage crates generate random loot, and the skill books are a very small part of that random loot pool.
<br />
<br />[/size][url=http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Workbench_crate][size=3]The Wiki[/size][/url][size=3] calculates that you have a [i][u][b][color=#fce5cd]less than 10% chance of seeing a single book[/color][/b][/u][/i] from any given crate, let alone the [i][b]four[/b][/i] that have a chance to appear each time a crate is opened for the first time.  This means that [/size][i][color=#cc4125][size=3][b]the most likely outcome from the entire DLC is that you won't see a single book[/b][/size][/color][/i][size=3][b].[/b]  Meanwhile, if you visit a casino with high Luck, you will consistently beat the odds at every game.[/size]
<br />
<br />
<br />[size=3]This is so patently unfair that the traditional approach of many players is to "save scum" -- reload saves over and over -- until they get at least one or two books from each crate.  This can be accomplished by reloading just outside the locations where the crates appear.  It is a tedious process, not to mention immersion-breaking, and players traditionally stop trying after getting just two books from a crate, due to the extreme unlikelihood of seeing more than that.[/size]
<br />
<br />
<br />[size=3]Here are the odds, as quoted from the Wiki:[/size][size=3]
<br />
<br />[/size][list]
<br />[*][size=3]84.64%: No skill books.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]9.79%: One skill book.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]7.92%: Two skill books.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]0.16%: Four skill books.[/size]
<br />[/list]
<br />[size=3]As you can see, the appearance of even a single skill book requires some uncommon Luck (if we're talking about a guaranteed roll).[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Given this fact, plus my examination of how Luck affects casinos, I have situated the influence of Luck in this manner:[/size]
<br />
<br />
<br />[list]
<br />[*][size=4][color=#d0e0e3]1 through 7 Luck:[/color] [color=#f9cb9c][b]No change.[/b][/color][/size]
<br />[*][size=4][color=#d0e0e3]8 Luck:[/color] [color=#b6d7a8][b]One or two skill books.[/b][/color][/size]
<br />[*][size=4][color=#d0e0e3]9 Luck:[/color] [color=#b6d7a8][b]Three skill books.[/b][/color][/size]
<br />[*][size=4][color=#d0e0e3]10 Luck:[/color] [color=#b6d7a8][b]Four skill books.[/b][/color][/size]
<br />[/list]
<br />[size=3]
<br />Luck values of 1 through 7 are unremarkable in the grand scheme of things -- you need better luck than that [i]in real life[/i] for the random number generator to award you a skill book on the first try.  And on the other end of the spectrum, it goes without saying that the grand prize for being the luckiest person on the planet should be nothing less than the secure knowledge that you will get the best those crates have to offer.  So if you want to get all 16 books legitimately, you may need to track down some gear, invest in an upgrade, or do some [i]Intense Training[/i].  Nobody said this was going to be easy!  Unless, of course, your character already possesses the ability to do a [url=http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Vit-o-matic_Vigor_Tester]Two-Headed Coin Flip[/url].
<br />
<br />
<br /> The important thing is that [color=#ff0000][b][u]it is now possible to handcraft a character build without having to concede 30+ skill points to bad luck in [i]Honest Hearts[/i].[/u][/b][/color]  For anyone who intends to eventually play the [url=http://fallout.gamepedia.com/JSawyer]jsawyer mod[/url], or perhaps work on a [i]Logan's Loophole[/i] build which halts leveling at 30, skill points are suddenly a big deal again.  In the vanilla game, one can comfortably cap every skill by level 50 without taking the [i]Educated[/i] or [i]Comprehension[/i] perks, or indeed without even stealing any books from anyone.  With jsawyer's level 35 cap, or the level 30 cap of [i]Logan's Loophole[/i], it's not so simple.
<br />
<br />
<br />[b][color=#fce5cd]Still not convinced?  Remember these points:[/color][/b]
<br />
<br />[list]
<br />[*][color=#fce5cd][size=3][b]The skill books from the [i]Honest Hearts[/i] storage crates represent the [u]ONLY[/u] wildcard in one's final character build.[/b][/size][/color]
<br />[*][size=3][color=#fce5cd]Luck [i]does[/i] have other non-combat effects in New Vegas - specifically the literally unrealistic advantage it grants in casinos - so[/color] [color=#cc4125][b]there is precedent[/b][/color][b][color=#cc4125].[/color][/b][/size]
<br />[*][size=3][color=#fce5cd]Recall how New Vegas handles speech challenges?[/color]  [b][color=#cc4125]You either have the requisite attributes or you don't; there [i]is[/i] no save scum option.[/color][/b][/size]
<br />[*][size=3][color=#fce5cd]Last but not least,[/color] [b][color=#cc4125]this mod doesn't give you [i]anything[/i] that you could not, with time and patience, earn without the mod[/color][/b][color=#fce5cd]... But reloading your game a thousand times is immersion-killing, whereas this mod, I argue, fits in nicely with the established lore and mechanics.[/color][/size]
<br />[/list]
<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]As of version 1.1, the one and only crate in the game which has a small (10%) chance of holding a bottle of Nuka-Cola Quantum will also obey the player character's Luck.  A Luck of 9+ ensures the bottle will appear.  Otherwise it's up to random chance as usual.[/color][/b]
<br />
<br />
<br />[u]Some technical details[/u]:
<br />[/size][list=1]
<br />[*][size=3]While the crate's initial contents are spawned when the player enters the crate's given location, the Luck-influenced redraw (if any) only occurs at the moment the box is opened.  It is therefore safe to wait until then before taking any extra steps to improve Luck.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]The "no change" for Luck values below 8 means precisely that: The crate's contents remain untouched.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]If the crate's initial contents includes books, these books DO NOT get deleted.  The rest of the contents are exchanged for additional books, if necessary, to reach the mandated total.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3][b][i]The emergence of Luck-spawned books PRECISELY follows the rules laid out by the original crate contents' reckoning.[/i][/b]  Therefore you will, for example, tend to get more Science books under most circumstances.  (Just not the four book circumstance.)[/size]

[b][size=4]Jackpot - A Lovingly crafted and Lore Friendly Unique Anti-Materiel Rifle.[/size][/b]
<br />
<br />A massive thanks to [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTMpIhG7VJBPuFgXhR8ky-w]DarkPopulous[/url] for featuring our mod on his Youtube Channel! Check the video out [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-HCidiNYIM]here[/url] and make sure to give him a like and subscribe as he has some very high quality tutorials.
<br />
<br />﻿   ﻿**Updated to 1.3**
<br />-added custom Pipboy Icon with dollar sign eyes
<br />-Improved texture contrast and bump map to strengthen filigree details
<br />
<br />   ﻿﻿**Updated to 1.2**
<br />-Critical hits with Jackpot now have a Unique "DING DING DING" sound effect! This change was based on a suggestion from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/2016888]Doomwolf82002[/url] and made possible with assistance from the Legendary [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/1026866]weijiesen[/url]! 
<br />-Unique holster sound restored to stock as it was always intended for Critical hits, I just lacked the skill to implement it until now.
<br />
<br />   ﻿**Updated to 1.1**
<br />-specular map fixed for black areas
<br />-revised scope reticle based on feedback (Now less fancy, more militaristic, but still unique)
<br />-other small tweaks to some gold areas
<br />
<br />[b][size=4]   ﻿History[/size][/b]
<br />
<br />For Christmas 2019 my wife [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/4228010]Avariella[/url] who is a talented texture artist, offered to texture something special for me in a game. I immediately knew I wanted a custom AMR in New Vegas to add a little flavor to my late-game Sniper build. I wanted it to be extravagant and look like the single most valuable object in the game, to hell with practicality. We eventually settled on a Solid gold look, with black Alcantara/Leather details and elegant carved filigree in just the right places. I also wanted it keep in line with the original unique weapons in the game. According to the Dev team, because there were no item descriptions in game, they tried to make the unique weapons tell a story through design alone. Eventually we came up with a Vegas/Slot machine aesthetic and named it Jackpot, then placed the weapon in a hidden location on The Strip.
<br />
<br />The texture alone took my wife over 100 hours to complete and has exceeded my greatest expectations. Making shiny metal look right in an engine as old as New Vegas' is no easy task, you can't just paint it gold colour and slap a shine map on it. Every individual surface has to be painted with highlights and shading and then the shader maps have to be tweaked just right. I'm sure when you see this weapon in game, catching light from the sun, you will agree that the time spent was well worth it.
<br />
<br />[b]   [size=4]﻿Details[/size]
<br />
<br />[/b]- A unique hand-painted (from scratch) texture. The weapon is gold-plated with elegant carved filigrees on the barrel, scope, muzzle-break and body
<br />
<br />-Custom Equip and Critical Hit sounds. When you equip the weapon you hear a classic mechanical slot machine. Score a critical hit and you'll be rewarded with the "DING DING DING" and coin splash of a Jackpot win! Sounds custom mixed and arranged by myself using free SFX off the web.
<br />
<br />-Custom Scope reticle 
<br />
<br />- A lore-friendly location in game. Hint below and spoilers even lower.
<br />
<br />   [b][size=4]﻿Stats[/size]
<br />[/b]
<br />- Buffs
<br />   -﻿Damage and critical damage 130/130 up from 110/110.
<br />   ﻿-Increased rate of fire to the same as the (GRA) Custom Action version
<br />   ﻿-Decreased AP cost to 45 down from 55. This still means you will only get 2 shots off in 95% of scenarios but it's nice to have a few more points left.
<br />   ﻿-Increased Zoom around 15%
<br />   ﻿-Charisma +1 while equipped. Because if you're carrying around a Giant, Golden, .50 Cal Anti-Materiel Rifle, people are going to notice.
<br />
<br />- Nerfs - The team that developed New Vegas believed every upgrade should come with a compromise of some kind so I've done the same.
<br />   ﻿﻿-Cannot be modded
<br />   ﻿-Weight increased from 20 to 25 because Gold is [b]Heeeavy[/b] man.
<br />   ﻿- Sneak skill -20 while equipped - I love this nerf, it's logical and mechanically  interesting, while simultaneously quashing complaints from angry nerd types (such as myself) who would otherwise yell "A sniper rifle shouldn't be shiny! It would give away your position!" Well it does, so shut up... me...
<br />
<br />[b]   [size=4]﻿Location Hint[/size]
<br />[/b]
<br />-Word getting around is one of the families on The Strip hired a dangerous man for some kind of hush hush operation...
<br />
<br />
<br />[b]﻿**SPOILER WARNING BELOW**[/b]
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />[b]﻿**SPOILER WARNING**
<br />
<br />[/b]The weapon can be found in a "Hard" locked safe, hidden behind a cupboard in the suite belonging to "Clanden" in Gomorrah (the same one containing his snuff tapes). I had always thought it was a borderline plot-hole that this crazed arms dealer had no special weapons in his possession. Well he does now, and it's a beast. The location also suits the theme. If you want to summon it the ID is: xx000800

Kinghtmare Fiends - Main File 1.0.0
====================================================
By YanL for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

This mod adds a lot of fun armor for Fiends. Vanilla body only. See the images for more details.
<br />
<br />I chose to put their cattle skulls on the left arm, because I don't like their helmets.
<br />
<br />[b][size=4]Probably compatible with everything out there. I just changed the list of their armor. It's almost cosmetic, but the helmets have 2 Dt instead of 1.[/size][/b]
<br />
<br />Not much to say.......that is it lol. Install and play. I hope you like it.
<br />
<br />OBS1: Ghoulification armor is not playable and to repair a armor, you can use any armor of this mod. Same for helmets.
<br />OBS2: You need all five main dlcs.
<br />
<br />==============================================
<br />
<br />Credits:
<br />
<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/575069]nekronom12[/url] - for the ghoul mask. Love it, I've been wanting to use this for a while, and now I had the opportunity.
<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/68531390]MarsPistol[/url] - because I used assets from his three mods lol. ESTELAR work, I'm a fan.
<br />Jokerine - some feet for vanilla body.

Kriss Vector main file 0.9.0
====================================================
By Eprdox for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

***Kriss Vector for Fallout:New Vegas v1.0***<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks AdayDr1en for showing me what I did wrong with glow maps. <br />  <br /><br />Ok, here is the update. Since you requested it, I removed the old scope from M40a5 and added iron sights, plus I made few modifications, including new reticule for holographic sights. And I also removed the vertical grip. I didn&#39;t make any custom grip animation, so if anyone wants to do it, be my guest.<br /><br />***V.09 readme***<br /><br />***Warning this is High poly model, on older machines it might slow the game performance especially with the scope installed.***<br /><br />It is been a long time since I posted any mod. But today I present you my latest gun, the Kriss Vector. I know that there is Kriss Vector on the forum already (called Griss), but I started work on mine before the Griss was posted and since mine is quite different I decided to post it anyway. So what can you expect from this mod:<br /><br />- 3 camo version (default night, digi pattern, desert pattern)<br />- 3 mods :<br />          - tactical attachments (adds accuracy)<br />          - suppressor (silences weapon)<br />          - High power scope (my old scope from m40a5)<br /><br />Since there were many complaints about the placement of my previous mods (gunrunnes shop), I decided to put this one in a ordinary box at Yangtze memorial. This gun is chambered in 9mm and holds 40 bullets (real life 9 mm version is in development, so I am not sure how much it will holds). There are several problems I encountered, hence it is marked as v0.9, so please if anyone from the community knows how to fix them send me a mail, leave comment or leave a message on the forum:<br />        -same bug as with m40a5: texture sets are not working properly, they are messing texture (using the one they shouldn&#39;t)<br />        -glow maps do not work<br /><br />[youtube]xXi3pS2gPME[/youtube] [youtube]3B73oW4UfnQ[/youtube]<br />[youtube]VRo6ZXBWEQk[/youtube] <br /><br />***P3D file (Fully modded desert version - ingame appearance differs slightly)***<br /><br />[b]Kriss - Fallout New Vegas mod[/b] ([url=http://p3d.in/WUjnZ]View in 3D[/url])<br />[url=http://p3d.in/WUjnZ][img]http://p3d.in/model_data/snapshot/WUjnZ[/img][/url]<br /><br />***Installation***<br /><br />Just copy the esp and bsa in the data folder of your game installation.<br /><br />***Credit***<br /><br />joefoxx082 for Animation replacers mod<br /><br />***Contact***<br />Got comment, suggestion, contact me on paraeprdox at gmail.com<br />

Logic and Consistency Fixes 1.3.0
====================================================
By qwerty for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

This is a collection of small mods, which fix some strange things in the game. These are not straight up "bug fixes", but small improvements aimed at people who like attention to details.
<br />
<br />[center][size=4][b]Main File[/b][/size][/center]
<br />The main (merged) version includes all of the individual files + the following mods:
<br />[list]
<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53846#]Nipton Fires Extinguished[/url]﻿ by me
<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64309]Janet Rakes[/url]﻿ by tranquilTulip
<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65600]Dead Horses Training Limb Damage Fix[/url]﻿ by me
<br />
<br />[/list]
<br />[center][size=3][b]Individual Files[/b][/size][/center]
<br />[b]﻿[b][Ver. 1.3] Campfire Recipes Cleaned
<br />[/b][/b]Cleans up campfire recipes list:
<br />- Recipes involving specific DLC items (Datura Root, Cloud Residue and Salient Green) will not show up until player has the required item in inventory.
<br />- Moved some recipes between "Aid", "Chems" and "Food" sub-categories, for example Healing Powder is now under "Aid" and Mass Purified Water under "Food".
<br />- Poisons are now under "Misc" category.
<br />- Datura Hide recipe moved to campfire from workbench.[b][b]
<br />
<br />[/b][/b][b][b][Ver. 1.3] Fiery Purgative Equip Sound
<br />[/b][/b]Adds an equip sound to Fiery Purgative item from Lonesome Road DLC, which was previously missing one.
<br />
<br />[b][b][Ver. 1.3] Mojave Cave Fungus[/b][/b]
<br />Replaces some of the static version of cave fungus in main game locations with harvestable versions of Cave Fungus (from Honest Hearts) and Mutant Cave Fungus (from Old World Blues).
<br />Green glowing fungi were replaced with mutant version, red and neutral-colored - with regular cave fungus.
<br />
<br />[b]﻿[b][Ver. 1.2] Silver Rush Second Guard
<br />[/b][/b]Adds a second guard to Silver Rush door during Birds of a Feather quest, after Gloria Van Graff tells the player, that she's found somebody for this job.
<br />Effect is retroactive, if you're on existing savegame after completing Birds of a Feather and Van Graffs are alive, walk into Silver Rush and then back out and the guard will appear.
<br />
<br />[b]﻿[Ver. 1.2] Doc Mitchell Items Ownership[/b]
<br />Makes all items in Doc Mitchell's house owned, so taking them counts as stealing.[b][b][b]
<br />[/b][/b][/b]Additionally, patient bed (the one where the game starts) is no longer owned, so it can be used for the player to sleep.[b][b][b]
<br />
<br />[Ver. 1.1][/b] Map Marker Reputation Tweaks[/b]
<br />[/b]Tweaks displayed faction reputation on several map markers:
<br />- Legion Raid Camp will show Caesar's Legion reputation
<br />- Red Rock Drug Lab and Great Khan Encampment will show Great Khans reputation
<br />- Follower's Outpost and New Vegas Medical Clinic will show Followers reputation
<br />- Camp Forlorn Hope will show NCR reputation
<br />- If HELIOS One power plant is taken by Legion forces, it will show Legion reputation, instead of NCR[b]
<br />
<br />[b][b][Ver. 1.1][/b] Weightless Unplayable Ammo[/b]
<br />[/b]Makes all unplayable ammo types weightless, even in hardcore mode.
<br />In practice, that means that ED-E (and potential other robot companions 
<br />from mods) will not have "ghost" weight in their inventory.
<br />Funny thing is, YUP already fixes a couple of such ammo types, but for some reason not all of them.[b]
<br />
<br />[b][b][Ver. 1.1][/b] G.I. Blues Rotface Fix[/b]
<br />[/b]Tweaks dialogue conditions, so the option to ask Rotface for help during "G.I.
<br /> Blues" quest is always available (as long as it's relevant, of course).
<br />Previously it was only possible to get information from him before visiting one of the squatter camps.[b]
<br />
<br />[Ver. 1.0] Usable Big Horn Saloon Bar Stools[/b]
<br />In vanilla game 6 stools in Big Horn Saloon are non-interactable. I can only assume this was done because of the height difference between the stools and the bar counter, which resulted in minor clipping during sitting animations. I have created an alternative stool model with slightly longer legs and tweaked their positions, so the animations line up now. I have also removed the "persistent" flag from one of the stools, as it really had no need for it.
<br />
<br />[b][b][Ver. 1.0][/b] HELIOS One Tower Sanity[/b]
<br />In vanilla game the interior of this tower was really strange - you apparently ride an elevator to "observation level" and get into this huge room with multiple levels, then step outside only to realize how small the exterior of the tower is. I have tried to fix this with as little impact on interior structure as possible:
<br />- "HELIOS One Observation Level" interior is renamed to "HELIOS One Control Room";
<br />- the original elevator is replaced with regular utility door;
<br />- the door to outside world is replaced with the elevator.
<br />With these changes I feel that the whole layout makes a bit more sense.
<br />
<br />[b][b][Ver. 1.0][/b] Boulder City Neutral Option[/b]
<br />When you try to negotiate with Great Khans during "Boulder City Showdown" quest and don't have sufficient Speech skill, you can return to Lt. Monroe and tell him that you're unable to negotiate a deal, to which he literally replies "[i]It was worth a try. I'll have to proceed with the attack as ordered, then.[/i]" What he does next? Nothing! Absolutely nothing, he just continues to sit there, waiting indefinitely.
<br />With this mod NCR will actually attack after Lt. Monroe says so, which results in:
<br />- a fight between NCR soldiers and Great Khans, which with 99% certainty will result in NCR victory;
<br />- death of both hostages;
<br />- quest completion without any faction reputation adjustments for the player;
<br />- if by some miracle Great Khans manage to win the fight, they'll travel to Red Rock Canyon as normal.
<br />
<br />[b][b][Ver. 1.0][/b] Matching Doors[/b]
<br />Fixes instances of mismatching exterior/interior door models in following locations:
<br />- The Bison Steve Hotel 2nd Floor
<br />- West Pump Station
<br />- NCR Military Police HQ
<br />- Michael Angelo's Workshop
<br />- HELIOS One Power Plant
<br />- Jacobstown Lodge
<br />
<br />[b][b][Ver. 1.0][/b] Vault 21 Hotel Proper Sinks[/b]
<br />Moves the sinks in Vault 21 Hotel rooms to where you'd expect them to be (see image section).
<br />Doing this required creating custom table meshes with holes for the sink, which is probably the reason for original strange sink placement.

Lonesome Road Followers 1_1 1.1.0
====================================================
By Quetzlsacatanango for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

This mod simply allows you to go back to DLC locations and retrieve your followers, who will now follow you like any other vanilla companion.

Now with Ulysses from Lonesome Road-
If you resolved things peacefully with Ulysses, you will find him at the vista, just inside the Canyon Wreckage overlooking The Divide.
I left his ugly mask on, but made it playable, so if you think it\'s awful like I do, you can remove it. I gave him a somewhat similar \"true\" face, and a wig of his regular hairstyle.
Has not been exhaustively tested but seems to work well enough. 
He will still have all of the regular post-quest dialog that the non-follower has, some of it, like asking why he is \"here\", or asking about stuff he found in the Courier\'s Mile, are only available when he is un-hired.
No voices, it is too much of a PITA. If someone else wants to do it I will be happy to give you instructions.
The only difference between 1.0 and 1.1 is that 1.1 has a mastered esp, so that he will actually be black (vanilla problem with NPCs added by plugins).
Please report issues in the comments.

Thanks to Mahare for providing voices for Dean and Waking Cloud. They are available under optional files. Give him kudos.

DM 1.5 - Adds Dean Domino as a re-recruitable companion. Go back to his apartment to pick him up.
Christine can be found in her Sierra Madre suite.
You will need to go get her before you leave, or else you\'ll need a mod to allow you to return to Sierra Madre.
Various bug fixes

HH 1.4 - Adds L38 functionality to Waking Cloud and JG. 

Waking Cloud
Full Burned Man Race
Burned Man voices

Joshua Graham can be found in Angel Cave, possibly cleaning his guns.
You need to re-enter Zion or at least walk around the reward chest to enable him.

He will give his \'way of the caananite\' perk. 
No perk for Christine, it doesn\'t make sense without the collar.

Feel free to use these files as a base for your own companion expansion mods.

Requirements:
Christine requires Dead Money DLC
Joshua Graham requires Honest Hearts DLC *and* \"Authentic Burned Man\" by RocketLombax (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41974)

Installation:
Extract contents to New Vegas\\Data directory

Credits:
Bethesda
Obsidian
Rocketlombax for Authentic Burned Man
Mahare for providing Dean/Waking Cloud voices
Myself
Use as you please as long as you credit those above.

Lower-sitting Ranger Hats 1.1.0
====================================================
By Finnen Hawke for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[size=3]Some tweaks to the way Ranger Hat and Park Ranger Hat rest on the head. I understand that these hats usually don't sit too low (hence my changes are rather subtle) but I just couldn't stand looking at them floating above the heads. I checked some pictures of real-life California State Park Rangers that wear similar hats and adjusted it to be similar. [/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Works for both male and female characters (they both seem to use the same model). I looked around but couldn't find any other mod that does it.  [b]No ESP files - just meshes modifications. Can be installed / uninstalled at any time.[/b][/size]
<br />
<br />[size=4][b]Ranger Hat
<br />[/b][/size]
<br />[i]Corresponding .nif file: meshes/armors/headgear/rangerhat/rangerhat.nif[/i]
<br />
<br />Changes: I simply slightly lowered the whole hat, nothing else.
<br />
<br />[size=4][b]Park Ranger Hat (from Honest Hearts DLC)[/b][/size]
<br />
<br />[size=2][i]Corresponding .nif file: meshes/nvdlc02/armor/parkrangerhat/nvdlc02parkrangerhat.nif
<br />
<br />[/i][/size]Changes: Initially I wanted to lower the whole hat down, however, I realized that it's very tricky. The whole hat is a bit smaller than the vanilla Ranger Hat, which caused issues during repositioning - female hairstyles were clipping from beneath the hat as soon as I lowered it. I took a careful look at this hat and realized that this one tends to sit a bit higher due to the way it's shaped. 
<br />
<br />Instead of lowering the whole hat down, I slightly readjusted it so the back of the hat sits a bit lower. Obsidian wanted to keep it straight, but it made it look unnatural from the side - the back of the hat seemed to be floating. I changed the angle slightly, so it now looks like it actually rests on the back of the head, while the front remains on the more-or-less same height.
<br />
<br />[size=3]If you don't like one or the other, just remove the corresponding mesh file and you'll get vanilla hat back. [/size]
<br />
<br />[size=2]Also, you can also personalize the hat position by yourself, it's very easy:[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=2]1. Download NifSkope
<br />2. Open the .nif file from my mod
<br />3. You'll see the model of the hat. Right-click on it and choose "Transform &gt; Edit"
<br />4. In a new window, you have X, Y, Z positions. Z moves the hat up or down.
<br />5. Set Z to, for example, 1 and click OK.
<br />6. Right-click the hat again and pick "Transform &gt; Apply". Your change will be applied and you'll see the hat move up or down.
<br />7. Save the file, run the game, check how it looks, repeat if necessary :)[/size]

<br />[u][color=#ff7700][size=5]Description[/size][/color][/u]
<br />=====================
<br />
<br />Major overhaul of the Lucky 38 suite. 
<br />This suite takes one complete level of the Lucky 38 tower and it is now possible to see the sky from the windows all over the place.
<br />[u]Original Mod[/u]; [url]http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40731/
<br />[/url][u]Russian Translation (Not Nexus):[/u] [url=http://falcon-lair.com/files/file/393-pererabotannyi-liuks-laki-38-lucky-38-suite-reloaded/]http://falcon-lair.com/files/file/393-pererabotannyi-liuks-laki-38-lucky-38-suite-reloaded/[/url]
<br />
<br />[u][color=#ff7700]Items Sorter (2.00)[/color][/u]
<br />Featuring models from DantheGeek, the suite includes a broad-range item sorter.
<br />
<br />Storage / Sorter :
<br />
<br />- Weapons display
<br />- Ammo storage shelves
<br />- Ammo components Storage shelves
<br />- Armors lockers
<br />- Misc items container
<br />- Food fridge
<br />- Beverage fridge
<br />- Bookshelves
<br />- Armor Mannequins
<br />
<br />Please note that corresponding storage areas have to be bought before use. You can find them in the upgrade store.
<br />
<br />[u][color=#ff7700][size=5]Features[/size][/color][/u]
<br />=====================
<br />
<br />[color=#ff7700][u]Armory [/u]
<br />[/color]The suite features an armory to display the Courier's proud collection of weapons and ammunition.
<br />
<br />[u][color=#ff7700]Infirmary[/color][/u]
<br />The suite contains it's own infirmary, including: 
<br /> - MK1 AutoDoc - From facial surgery to a simple haircuit.
<br /> - Med Storage Shelves
<br /> - Recovery Chamber - To completely heal your character of all the damage caused by the Mojave.
<br />
<br />[u][color=#ff7700]Laboratory[/color][/u]
<br />The laboratory is a large section of the suite, which can be customized and upgraded through the terminal system.
<br />
<br />[u][color=#ff7700]Alfred[/color][/u]
<br /> One of the most distinctive aspects of the suite is your personal robot servant, Alfred.
<br />Programmed by KospY, who was inspired by an idea from Gnubee, Alfred will sort your items and serve you in the suite. As well as being able to find him by the door, several intercoms are placed around the suite, so he can come to you.
<br />
<br />
<br />[color=#ff7700][b][u]Performance Optimization (New 3.00) [/u][/b]
<br />[/color] By adjusting lighting and environmental variables and by removing old unnecessary scripts, I have been able to optimize the suite's performance in comparison to Version 2.
<br />
<br />[b][u][color=#ff7700]Aesthetics[/color][/u]
<br /> Aesthetically, the suite remains virtually identical to Version 2.00, however both lighting and ambient adjustments have been made to remove the 'creepy, annoying' ambiance from v2.00 and improve the overall feel of the suite.
<br />
<br />[u][color=#ff7700]The Lucky 38 Suite System[/color][/u]
<br /> Each room in the suite can be upgraded and customized, using terminals in certain rooms. Since Version 2.00, I have made many changes to this system, with the following:
<br /> - New radio station controller
<br /> - New items
<br /> - A text adventure game has been added
<br />- Jane and Marilyn can be summoned to the suite via telephone
<br />
<br />[u][color=#ff7700]Teleporter[/color][/u]
<br /> The Lucky 38 teleport device rids the need of traversing through the strip and into the Lucky 38. However, one must obtain the schematics for this device, and have a science skill of 50 to use it at full power.
<br />
<br />With the Teleport Device you can : 
<br />
<br />- Teleport yourself back to the suite.
<br />- Set 3 custom locations
<br />
<br />[u]To use it : 
<br />[/u]
<br />- Activate it via the pipboy and close your pip boy revealing a menu.
<br />- Activate it via a preset hotkey,
<br />
<br />Please note that the teleporter device needs energy to be used. 
<br />For now, the best source of energy is fission battery, which is required before use.
<br />The Teleport Device can be used 4 times before the fission battery runs out. You can recharge it in the fission battery charger near the teleporter (you have to buy it first).
<br />
<br />[color=#ff7700][u]Fission battery Charger[/u]
<br />[/color]
<br />Using this, drained fission batteries can be replenished for use. Since version 2.00, I have optimized the code behind the system, making it far more reliable.
<br />
<br />[u][color=#ff7700]Balcony[/color][/u]
<br /> The suite now features a purchasable balcony, looking over the New Vegas Strip. This includes a fridge, grill, sunbeds and beverages! Companion friendly and compatible with NVR!
<br />
<br />[color=#ff7700][u]Water Purifier[/u]
<br />[/color] You can now purify your water in the kitchen by boiling it. (Yes, I know boiling won't rid the deadly nuclear waste from your water) This is a very simple feature, please use your imagination. :)
<br />
<br />[color=#ff7700][u]Working Fireplace[/u]
<br />[/color] You can now feel more at-home with a working fireplace!
<br />
<br /> [color=#ff7700][u]Ice Cold Nuka Cola Fridge[/u]
<br />[/color] Ice Cold Nuka Cola Fridges are purchasable through the Lucky 38 upgrade system. Put your Nuka Cola in and watch [i][color=#00ffff]Ice Cold[/color][/i] Nuka Cola come out.
<br />
<br />[color=#ff7700][u]Radio Station Controller [/u]
<br />[/color] This allows you to flick between Mojave Music Radio and Radio New Vegas at a click of a button. (Possibility of introducing Wave Radio in the future)
<br />
<br />[color=#ff7700][b][u]Washing Machine[/u][/b]
<br />[/color]Thanks to the suite's washing machine, the courier is able to wash dirty clothes which they may have in their inventory. Keep it clean.
<br />
<br />[color=#ff7700][b][u]Magazine Bookshelf[/u][/b]
<br />[/color]Always hated that inability to display your collection of comics, magazines and books? No problem, the suite now incorporates a fully functional bookshelf in the master bedroom.
<br />
<br />[b][u][color=#ffff00]VR Pod[/color][/u][/b]
<br /> The highlight of Version 3's update is the creating of a [color=#00ff00]working VR Pod[/color]. This can be purchased via the terminal for 1000 caps, and has three software programs that can be loaded:
<br /> - Stealth Simulator
<br /> - Close-Quarters Combat Simulator
<br /> [b]- Shooting Range[/b]
<br />
<br />
<br /> The pod is still a prototype and is still experimental. If anyone has any bugs, or any ideas for it, please let me know via the comments or private message.
<br />
<br />[b][u][i][color=#00ff00]There is plenty more to discover...[/color][/i][/u][/b]
<br />

<br />[/color][/size][spoiler]
<br />I recommend you to add them in your own beauty mod such as "Project Mikoto" or "Lings choiffeur",if your custom race is COMPATIBLE with them,otherwise just add it to the custom race esp file.
<br />

<br />
<br />[/font]1 - Open the G.E.C.K.[font=palatino linotype]

<br />[/font]3 -  Change the meshes (.nif files) and textures (.dds files) [font=palatino linotype]
<br />[/font] of Mikto female Hairs with those provided by this mod.[font=palatino linotype]
<br />[/font]4 - Save.[font=palatino linotype]
<br />
<br />How to add hairs to Custom races
<br />
<br />1 - Open the G.E.C.K.
<br />2 - add new a new hairstyle from the top menu
<br />"character&gt;hair&gt;New" .
<br /> Make sure to set "playable" and do not set "fixed color".
<br />
<br />[OR  duplicate an existing hair]
<br />
<br />4 -  Change the meshes (.nif files) and textures (.dds files) 
<br />5 - Add the newly created hairstyles into the race tab called "FACE DATA". 
<br />(drag and drop them into the apropriate space)

NCRCF 1.0.0

By Me444 for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

This mod is really simple make the convicts actually look like convicts. There is nothing much more to say I always thought the Powdergangers outfits looked quit stupid for recently escaped convicts, hence forth I made this mod. The new prison jumpsuits work for both female and male bodies as well as the g.o. world model when  dropped resembles the actual suit. <br /><br />  BEWARE&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; This changes all the outfits to jumpsuits no silly relaxed button up or a weird shirtless man with a sash just prisoner attire, also the guard armor is a police vest over the suit so it appears as if they hijacked the vest. This mod also changes the convicts in Primm and vault 19 just so your all aware <br /><br />This mod could conflict with populated wasteland by way of them adding more escaped convicts like the ones in Primm. If so they would have mercenary attire rather than the jumpsuits. Other than that this should not be a problem anywhere else.<br /><br />Thank you all for downloading&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Here is some of my other mods if interested Thanks again<br /><br />http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/57243/?<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58771/?

NAWEMO 1.2.0
====================================================
By migck for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[center][i][font=Arial][color=#ff0000][size=6][u][b]NPCs use Ammo Variants and Weapon Mods[/b][/u][/size][/color][/font]
<br />[size=1]"That is... I dunno, [color=#ff0000][b]NAWEMO[/b][/color]? Can I get a marketing grad over here?"[/size][/i][/center]
<br />[line]
<br />[size=3]...Oh hey there! Didn't see you coming in! I take it you're interested in whatever the hell that title means, so let me try and explain:
<br />
<br />As... peculiar as the choice of different ammo types for a weapon can be, the fact is that this feature is pretty much player-exclusive. An NPC could use ammo types other than the default one, only if it's the only choice in his inventory. As in, they only grab the first ammo they can find for their weapon's list of choices, and once selected they never bother to change it until it runs out. So even if you give, for example, AP and HP ammo to a companion, he's only going to expend one first regardless of what he's shooting at. There's pretty much no AI in place for other actors to evaluate their threat and swap their ammo.
<br />
<br />And what do we do in such situations? Same thing we always do Pinky, we script the hell out of it until it follows our vision!
<br />
<br />This mod implements a VERY comprehensive script for NPCs to choose and change their ammo. When an actor other than the player enters combat, the script is fired, and the actor is marked so that his ammo choice can be reevaluated each time he reloads his weapon, or every few seconds while he's still in combat but not currently in an attack animation, so as to try and not disrupt the flow of combat. There are options in MCM for how likely the actor is going to take the chance to check his ammo types, which can be modified by his Intelligence stat.
<br />
<br />The script basically assigns a "bullet score" to each kind of ammo in the actor's inventory that can be loaded in his equipped weapon. This score is pretty much the potential damage that the actor can cause to the target, and as such it crams what should be the game's own damage formula into it: weapon skill &amp; condition, target's DT &amp; DR, ammo effects like HP &amp; AP, even perks (for companions!), you name it, I doubt I left anything out. The ammo with the highest score wins, and the actor shall use it when possible. Again, options in MCM define the "accuracy", up or down, that the actor makes of this score, which can be modified by his Perception stat.
<br />
<br />[i][b]"BUT WAIT![/b][/i]", you scream, "what about specialty ammo types like incendiary and EMP rounds?", well those are handled a bit differently. These ammo types cause scripted effects that cannot be gathered straightforwardly by the scoring system, but they can still be used according to my custom rules.
<br />These ammo types will be used by the NPC ignoring the other ammo types, if the conditions for it are suiting. The mod also defines a few form lists in which these ammo types are to be grouped:
<br />
<br />[/size][list]
<br />[*][size=3][b]migNammoEMPList[/b]: this is intended for pulse ammunition, and as such it gathers the collection added by Gun Runner's Arsenal if detected: 12ga, 20ga, 25mm and 40mm pulse rounds. Ammo found here will be given immediate preference when fighting against robots and power armor-clad opponents.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3][b]migNammoBeanList[/b]: this is intended for ammo that can knock out the target, namely, 12ga Bean Bags. They will be given immediate preference if the target is standing, but the attacker will try to swap out of them as soon as that is no longer the case. Give your companions a shotgun and some bean bags, and enjoy the crowd control. [b]IMPORTANT[/b]: if you get hit by bean bags, you may get knocked out for several minutes. Use the latest version of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/63997]this mod[/url]﻿ and knockdowns should "only" last 30 seconds. Which generally still means you're screwed, but less so, so watch out![/size]
<br />[*][size=3][b]migNammoOtherSpecialList[/b]: do you have some other ammo that does special/zany stuff, and want it used often enough regardless of its score? Put it in this list, and every time the attacker evaluates his ammo choice, there will be a chance they'll swap to it directly.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3][b]PerkPyromaniacAmmo[/b]: the vanilla form list for incendiary ammo is of course used as well! They can be selected if the target is not fire-proof, and not currently in flames. It works just like the above, so by default, there's a 25% chance that the attacker will use these over the other choices. 50MG, 40mm, 12ga Dragon Breath and Rocket incendiary rounds are supported by default. If the chance doesn't roll, incendiary rounds are still given a slight score bonus in the comparison with the other rounds, because igniting the target can always be useful.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3][b]migNammoExcludeList[/b]: ammo types in this list will be barred from all the mod's system, they'll neither be used nor granted.[/size]
<br />[/list][line][size=3]
<br />All of this is good enough already, and opens up a game feature which was almost barred to NPCs. But it's not the only thing this mod does. This mod also gives NPCs the option to install any weapon mods they have in their inventory, to their weapons. With the latest developments in [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277]JIP LN[/url], [u][font=Comic Sans MS][b]WEAPON MODS ARE VISIBLE ON NPCs[/b][/font][/u]. Finally.
<br />(NOTE: companions excluded from this feature. Take your companion's weapon, install any mods, give it back to them. It just works (better))
<br />
<br />
<br />But, what good would all of this be, if NPCs don't even [i]have[/i] ammo variants or weapon mods in their inventories to begin with? Well, what kind of mod do you think this is, of course I also provide just for that eventuality! The final feature from this mod is to distribute ammo variants and weapon mods, just before all of the above may happen, and only once per NPC:
<br />[/size][list]
<br />[*][size=3]For every weapon in the actor's inventory, the script gathers the amount of its default ammo that the actor has, and rolls a chance to swap each such bullet with a variant from the weapon's list of ammo types, if possible.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]The script also rolls a chance to grant the actor each of the weapon mods that his weapons may have installed. These will be installed on his weapons as well.[/size]
<br />[/list][size=3]
<br />This feature is very similar to, and was actually inspired by, the loot distribution system from the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62941]Mojave Arsenal[/url] mod, and does in fact acknowledge it to avoid conflicts. Because MA makes the loot changes only when the actor is dead and the player proceeds to check it, this mod can either signal to MA that the actor has already been altered once its assignation of ammo and mods is done, or, by default, use MA's own method to assign the new items to the live actor, if you also have it installed.
<br />
<br />[b][u]Personally I'd advise you to stick to MA's method[/u][/b], since chances are it will distribute more sensible stuff. If you'd prefer to have ammo types and weapon mods from all your mods with little restriction, this mod's distribution method can be tuned in MCM and also factor the NPC's Luck stat in the calculations as well. However, do note that if you use this mod's native script together with MA, that mod now distributes ammo variants directly in leveled lists to NPCs and containers, so this mod will add even more ammo variants on top of that (I'd advise to set this mod's ammo distribution chance to 0% then). You're warned.
<br />
<br />[/size]
<br />[size=3][size=3]Since version 55.50 of the JIP LN plugin, it includes an engine patch to distribute and install weapon mods to NPCs by itself. 
<br />This mod will defer to it if you enable the patch in [size=3]JIP LN[/size]'s ini.
<br />[/size][/size][line][size=3]
<br />And well, that's more or less it. Enjoy getting set on fire, and watch out for pulse rounds when you go around in power armor, because you aren't so invulnerable in it now.
<br />This mod pretty much requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42507]MCM[/url] to configure. Without it you'll be restricted to default values.
<br />Uninstallation will leave any ammo variants and weapon mods granted by the mod to any altered NPCs, but that's hardly an issue I think.

NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash 7.5.1
====================================================
By Queue for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

Fixes the Windows 10 Anniversary Update + up-to-date Nvidia / AMD video driver crashes / issues for the following:[b]<br />Fallout New Vegas<br />Fallout New Vegas No Gore (German)<br />Fallout 3<br />Fallout 3 No Gore (German)<br />Oblivion<br />GECK (New Vegas)<br />GECK (Fallout 3)<br />Construction Set (Oblivion)<br />[/b][line]<br />Have you ever had New Vegas crash while trying to play? Of course you have. We all have.<br /><br />I may have a solution for you: NVAC.<br /><br />NVAC (short for New Vegas Anti Crash) is an NVSE plugin that implements structured exception handling and sanity checking to reduce frequency of game crashes.<br /><br />That said, I make no promises. This isn&#39;t a cure-all: it only tries to fix crashes related to access violation exceptions at specific offsets / addresses.<br /><br />Since it&#39;s an NVSE plugin, nvac.dll goes in your Data/NVSE/Plugins folder.<br /><br />After running New Vegas, you can double check that NVAC loaded by reading the nvac.log file found in your New Vegas folder; if nvac.log doesn&#39;t exist, consult nvse.log. NVAC does not fully support the German &#34;no gore&#34; variant of New Vegas; I simply don&#39;t have access to it to develop for it.<br /><br />Feel free to submit exceptions marked with a &#34;u&#34; or &#34;v&#34; in nvac.log in the comments. They will usually be the final entry in the log (since an unhandled exception will crash New Vegas). Please also submit &#34;e&#34; or &#34;s&#34; entries in the comments for addresses listed as &#34;preliminary&#34; (in the readme) as that means I haven&#39;t personally verified them; New Vegas shouldn&#39;t crash when these are logged, so it&#39;d require checking the log file arbitrarily after a play session. The log file is cleared each time New Vegas is started.<br /><br />As a bonus, NVAC implements helper function inlining (it takes internal New Vegas functions that can fit within a 5-byte space and replaces the function call with the 5-byte-or-less instruction) which is a minor performance improvement.<br /><br />NVAC can be removed at any time. NVAC isn&#39;t a normal New Vegas mod (esp / esm file); it&#39;s an NVSE plugin that modifies the game&#39;s executable code at runtime, but doesn&#39;t make any permanent changes. Nothing it does gets written out to a save the way changes made by esp / esm mods do.<br /><br />[b]Deciphering the nvac.log file:[/b]<br /><br />[code] 19195402 _ 00310000 03060000 nvac.dll[/code]<br />[code]&#34;19195402&#34;[/code] is a timestamp which can be read as dd:hh:mm:ss (day, hour, minute, second); in this example, (November) 19th, 7:54 pm and 2 seconds.<br />[code]       &#34;_&#34;[/code] is a single letter code that identifies the log entry type, which I&#39;ll elaborate on momentarily.<br />[code]&#34;00310000&#34;[/code] is a memory address; for most entries this is the address of an exception (crash).<br />[code]&#34;03060000&#34;[/code] is an informative value; in this example, the version number of nvac.dll<br />[code]&#34;nvac.dll&#34;[/code] is the module loaded at the logged address.<br /><br />[code] 19123249 u 0044AD6B C0000005 FalloutNV.exe[/code]<br />[code]&#34;19123249&#34;[/code] (November) 19th, 12:32 pm and 49 seconds.<br />[code]       &#34;u&#34;[/code] Unhandled exception.<br />[code]&#34;0044AD6B&#34;[/code] address where the exception occurred.<br />[code]&#34;C0000005&#34;[/code] exception code (EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION).<br />[code]&#34;FalloutNV.exe&#34;[/code] the exception occurred in the game&#39;s code.<br /><br />[b]The letter codes:[/b]<br /><br />[code]&#34;_&#34;[/code] entries are informative, relaying that NVAC was loaded and the base address of various DLLs.<br />[code]&#34;&#33;&#34;[/code] entries are informative, relaying human-readable text for the user.<br />[code]&#34;a&#34;[/code] entries are exceptions handled Automatically by NVAC&#39;s &#34;global&#34; exception handler.<br />[code]&#34;e&#34;[/code] entries are Exceptions handled specifically by NVAC&#39;s targeted code changes.<br />[code]&#34;f&#34;[/code] entries are Freezes (hangs) avoided specifically by NVAC&#39;s targeted code changes.<br />[code]&#34;h&#34;[/code] entries are exceptions identified Heuristically by NVAC&#39;s &#34;global&#34; exception handler, sometimes handled unsuccessfully.<br />[code]&#34;i&#34;[/code] entries are helper function Inliner errors indicating a data mismatch.<br />[code]&#34;m&#34;[/code] entries are &#34;Middle of nowhere&#34; exceptions, sometimes handled unsuccessfully.<br />[code]&#34;ñ&#34;[/code] entries are Null instruction exceptions, sometimes handled unsuccessfully.<br />[code]&#34;n&#34;[/code] entries are Null pointer call exceptions, sometimes handled unsuccessfully.<br />[code]&#34;o&#34;[/code] entries are stack Overflow exceptions, usually handled unsuccessfully.<br />[code]&#34;q&#34;[/code] entries are program self-termination information; these are effectively crashes.<br />[code]&#34;r&#34;[/code] entries are informative, relaying the next Return address.<br />[code]&#34;s&#34;[/code] entries are Sanity checks which prevent an exception.<br />[code]&#34;t&#34;[/code] entries are informative, relaying Thread information.<br />[code]&#34;u&#34;[/code] entries are Unhandled exceptions reported from the Unhandled Exception Filter; these are crashes.<br />[code]&#34;v&#34;[/code] entries are unhandled exceptions reported by NVAC&#39;s &#34;global&#34; exception handler; these are crashes.<br />[code]&#34;w&#34;[/code] entries are informative, relaying exception information as it passes through New Vegas&#39;s final exception handler.<br />[code]&#34;x&#34;[/code] entries are critical errors in Windows exception data; these entries should never occur.<br />[code]&#34;@&#34;[/code] entries are beta build entries that relay additional exception information.<br />[code]&#34;#&#34;[/code] entries are beta build entries that relay additional function hooking information.<br />[code]&#34;^&#34;[/code] entries are informative, relaying possible return address to main code from external library code.<br />[code]&#34;:&#34;[/code] entries are output from OutputDebugString calls.<br />[code]&#34;;&#34;[/code] entries are output from the game&#39;s own error checking.<br /><br />[b]Note to mod developers:[/b]<br /><br />I&#39;d highly recommend disabling NVAC (via your mod manager or by removing nvac.dll from your Data/NVSE/Plugins folder) while developing mods to make sure NVAC doesn&#39;t suppress any crashes that your mod causes and that could be solved on your end.<br /><br />[b]Changelog:[/b]<br /><br />7.5.1.0<br />- Fixed compatibility for automated install alongside TTW when using Mod Organizer.

<br />4.1.32 is up. Changes:
<br />improved overrides for both Critical Sections  and Hashtables - meaning, a small performance improvement
<br />rewrote "FPS management"
<br />rewrote what used to be the 64 Hertz Fix.  Not sure what, if anything (possibly FPS management is now taking care of everything important 64-hertz-related), it should do.  But it's adjustable, so maybe if there's something it needs to do that can be set from the ini file.  
<br />CS profiling now works
<br />improvements to HT profiling (ie it no longer crashes after a few minutes when enabled, plus a bunch of other improvements)
<br />got rid of some ini options that were never useful so far as I could tell
<br />
<br />4.1.31 is up. Changes:
<br />heap replacement should now properly support the extern heaps (tbmm, tcmalloc, fastmm4) on FNV &amp; FO3, not just Oblivion. 
<br />it now has hashtable overrides set up for 1.4.0.525, though they're not too optimized yet
<br />hashtable profiling has been completely redone and should now produce more complete information
<br />iFPSClamp should now be properly hooked, allowing MinimumFPS to actually be meaningful
<br />oh, and per request I attempted to set up the zip files structure to work with NMM correctly
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />New Vegas Stutter Remover (NVSR) is a port of Oblivion Stutter Remover / Fallout Stutter Remover to Fallout: New Vegas.  
<br />
<br />Requirements:
<br />The New Vegas Stutter Remover will not work without the New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE).  It requires version 1 beta 5 or later of NVSE.  
<br />You can download NVSE here: http://nvse.silverlock.org/
<br />NVSR does NOT support the no-gore versions for germany or whereever it is that uses those.  
<br />
<br />Settings Adjustments:
<br />Default configuration is aimed at maximum stability.  The settings are stored in sr_New_Vegas_Stutter_Remover.ini, in the Data/NVSE/Plugins Folder.  The following changes are for maximum performance: 
<br />1. [Recommended] In the "Master" section, change bReplaceHeap from 0 to 1.  If crashes result, go to the "Heap" section and change iHeapAlgorithm from 6 to 5, 3, or 2.  If you have used a 4GB / LAA enabler (which I recommend), then in the "Heap" section also change iHeapSize from 250 to, oh, 450 is probably enough.  
<br />2. [Not exactly recommended, but it probably won't hurt] In the "Master" section at the top, try changing bExperimentalStuff from 0 to 1.  Leave the stuff in the "Experimental" section how it is unless you feel like taking bigger risks.  
<br />3. [Not recommended] Go to the section named "OverrideList".  The second entry there should have a comment starting with "Renderer+0x080" and a version of "FalloutNV 1.4.0.525".  Change the setting named "Mode" there from 2 to 3 (a tiny bit higher FPS, a tiny bit worse stutter) or 5 (slightly higher FPS, slightly better stutter, significantly more prone to crashing though that varies from user to user).  
<br />
<br />Installation:
<br />note 1: with 4.1.31 and later versions it should now support installation with the Nexus Mod Manager, replacing steps 1 through 3 here.  
<br />note 2: with 4.1.33, NVSR now includes source code for itself in the "src" folder.  You can ignore that, it's probably useless to you.  
<br />1. Go to your Data folder, and create in it a new fold named NVSE. Now go in to that folder and create a new folder inside of it named Plugins. You can create a new folder by right-clicking inside of an old one and selecting "New", then selecting "Folder". If you already had such a path that's fine too.
<br />2. Make sure that the file sr_New_Vegas_Stutter_Remover.dll from the zip ends up in Data/NVSE/Plugins (the Plugins folder you created in step #1 above).
<br />3. If you have an old ini file for the Stutter Remover then either overwrite it with one that came with the new version or delete it so that the Stutter Remover will generate a new one with the new default settings. If you deleted the ini, then run the game so that the Stutter Remover will generate a new ini with the new default settings.  
<br />4. [optional, but recommended] See the "Settings Adjustment" section above.  
<br />
<br />Uninstalling:
<br />Remove sr_New_Vegas_Stutter_Remover.dll from the Data/NVSE/plugins folder.  
<br />
<br />If you have trouble getting NVSR to install / work:
<br />If you have difficulty understanding the install process, you can watch Gopher do it in this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MII4TO-G634
<br />Various things to check in the process of figuring out why stutter remover might not be working:
<br />1. sr_New_Vegas_Stutter_Remover.dll is in the right place?
<br />2. sr_New_Vegas_Stutter_Remover.ini gets created in the same folder as the dll when you run the game?  If the dll is in the right folder, and you still don't get an ini then you probably have not correctly installed / used the script extender (NVSE).  
<br />3. sr_New_Vegas_Stutter_Remover.log gets created in the game folder when you run the game?  It may contain useful information about what went wrong.  If it didn't get created or does not say anything, then proceed to #4...
<br />4. nvse.log gets created in the game folder when you run the game?  If not then you have not installed and used the script extender correctly.  If it's there, it should contain the lines like: "checking plugin C:/blah/blah/blah/Steam/steamapps/common/Fallout New Vegas/Data/NVSE/Plugins//sr_New_Vegas_Stutter_Remover.dll"
<br />"plugin C:/blah/blah/blah/Steam/steamapps/common/Fallout New Vegas/Data/NVSE/Plugins//sr_New_Vegas_Stutter_Remover.dll (00000001 sr_New_Vegas_Stutter_Remover 00004130) loaded correctly"
<br />(or something like that... the paths will vary depending upon where New Vegas got installed, and it will have backslashes instead of forward slashes)
<br />
<br />If Stutter Remover causes a problem:
<br />Find the file stutter remover ini file (Data/NVSE/Plugins/sr_New_Vegas_Stutter_Remover.ini).  See the section at the top of it labeled "Master".  Each line in that section enables or disables a category of features in the stutter remover.  Go through that section changing each "1" to a "0", one at a time, until your problem goes away.  Then contact me (by posting on either the nexus forum or the bethesda forum or PMing me on the nexus), and tell me what your problem was and which item you had to disable to make your problem go away.  
<br />
<br />Less Common Settings Changes:
<br />1. In the "Overrides" section at the end, find the line that says "CallerAddress = 0xA62B17".  Immediately after it is a line that "Mode = 2".  Changing that 2 to 3 should give you a tiny bit better FPS at a cost of a tiny bit worse stutter.  Or changing it to a 5 should give you a tiny bit better FPS and a tiny bit better stutter at a cost in reduced stability.  
<br />
<br />Known Issues:
<br />1. FPS reduction - this is INTENTIONAL.  You can disable it by changing MaximumFPS from 30 to 0 in your stutter remover ini file.  
<br />2. A number of issues are cropping up with the 64 Hertz Fix.  It fixes some major problems in New Vegas, but it's also reported to cause problems for some users with lip synch and some 3rd person camera things or something.  
<br />
<br />Version History:
<br />4.1.34 - Fixes issues involving bReplaceGetTickCount and bLogToConsole.  
<br />4.1.33 - Fixes possible crashing bug.  Slightly saner default settings.  Very small improvement to HT overrides, slight changes to logging, source code is now included, changed behavior of bReduceSleep &amp; iThreadsFixedToCPUs.  
<br />4.1.32 - improved CS overrides &amp; defaults, improved HT overrides, fixed CS profiling, rewrote FPS management, rewrote 64 hertz fix
<br />4.1.31 - improved HT overrides, hooked iFPSClamp, fixed external heaps, rewrote HT profiling, changed zip structure
<br />4.1.30 - improves support for 1.4.0.525
<br />4.1.29 - Adds basic support for 1.4.0.525.  
<br />Previously using NVSR with New Vegas 1.4.0.525 was only possible thanks to schlangsters NVSR patcher (as NVSR hacks FNV to improve performance, the NVSR patcher hacked NVSR to support FNV 1.4.0.525).  
<br />4.1.28 - Adds (incomplete, but fairly decent) support for 1.3.0.452.  Also attempts to add support for heap replacement, though that's off by default.  
<br />4.1.25 - Improves partial support of F:NV 1.2.0.352.  
<br />4.1.23 - Adds partial support F:NV 1.2.0.352.  
<br />4.1.17 - Fixes a bug that can set volume to zero in rare circumstances.  Also some other stuff that mostly should have no effect on the default settings.  
<br />4.1.16 - Seems to work.  The latest features are currently only working on decrypted executables, but they should work on non-decrypted executables too soon.  
<br />4.1.15 - worked on decrypted executables, crashed with steam
<br />4.1.14 - switched version numbering schemes to match the version numbers for Oblivion Stutter Remover and Fallout Stutter Remover; this version didn't work
<br />WIP5 - should perform better on 1.2.0.314 now
<br />WIP4 - adds more hooks for 1.2.0.314, doesn't actually improve performance more because of lack of data to configure it with, but now ready for collecting profiling data
<br />WIP3 - adds some support for 1.2.0.314; support for that version will be improved in WIP4.  NVSR WIP2 corresponds to stutter remover 4.1.7.  
<br />WIP2 - enables a lot more features, but completely untested at this time.  Most features only work on 1.2.0.285, but some features also work on older versions of FNV.  NVSR WIP2 corresponds to stutter remover 4.1.6.  
<br />WIP1 - first NVSE-based version, reported to work.  NVSR WIP1 corresponds to stutter remover 4.1.4.  
<br />preliminary_6, preliminary_5, preliminary_4, preliminary_3, attempt_2, and attempt_1 were versions prior to WIP1.  Unlike more recent versions they did not require NVSE.  
<br />
<br />Status of Stutter Remover features on Fallout: New Vegas:
<br />1. 64 Hertz fix
<br />Implemented &amp; working correctly in WIP1.  
<br />This removes some microstutter, particularly at high framerates.  
<br />2. Critical Section hooks
<br />Implemented &amp; working correctly in WIP1.  
<br />These can help some performance and stability issues relating to stutter, but mostly they just allow the next item on the list to work...
<br />3. Critical Section Overrides (in default configuration)
<br />Implemented in WIP2 for FNV 1.2.0.285 and in WIP5 for 1.2.0.314.  
<br />When done right, these can significantly improve performance.  
<br />4. FPS Management
<br />Partially implemented in WIP2, still missing slow-motion used to enforce MinimumFPS.  
<br />Some people perceive the game as smoother when its framerate is prevented from exceeding half the refresh rate, plus this helps free up resources for secondary threads.  
<br />5. Hashtable hooks
<br />Implemented in WIP2.  
<br />Don't really do anything to performance on their own, but necessary for the next item on the list...
<br />6. Hashtable Overrides (in default configuration)
<br />Minimal set should be present in WIP2 for 1.2.0.285, in WIP5 for 1.2.0.314.  Better set added as of 4.1.13.  Still has room for a few more small improvements here.  
<br />Should improve general performance.  
<br />7. FastExit hook
<br />Implemented in WIP2 and later.  
<br />Makes quitting faster.  May be disabled by default.  
<br />8. Heap Replacement
<br />Seems to be working.  
<br />9. Expiremental Stuff
<br />Partially supported as of 4.1.13 or WIP5 (can't remember which).

NVHR - AVX2 2.4.0
====================================================
By iranrmrf for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[center][font=Verdana][color=#ff8f00][size=5]﻿﻿[u]Installation[/u][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[color=#c9daf8][u]You will need a 4GB aware version of Fallout New Vegas for this to work.[/u] If you are using a 2GB version, it will not load. Simply place "d3dx9_38.dll" into your main game directory. If you would like to confirm that the heap replacement loads successfully, place "d3dx9_38.tmp" in the same folder. Both of these should be in the same folder as "FalloutNV.exe". If "d3dx9_38.tmp" is present, the game's console will appear. This will not affect anything in-game. If you no longer want the console to appear, you can delete "d3dx9_38.tmp". Recreating it will cause the console to reappear every time you launch the game. I recommend using NVTF with the option bModifyDirectXBehavior set to 1 (bModifyDirectXBehavior=1). It reduces memory usage significantly. It is imperative when using large texture mods.
<br />[/color]
<br />
<br />[color=#ff8f00][size=5][u]Conflicts[/u][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[color=#c9daf8]This should conflict with any existing heap replacer such as NVSR. It is possible to run this alongside NVSR as long as the relevant settings have been disabled. NVTF seems to have conflicts when "bSpinCriticalSections" is enabled. "DefaultHeapInitialAllocMB" in "nvse_config.ini" is now a pointless setting. It will affect absolutely nothing. NVSE v5.14 is incompatible, it has a severe memory corruption bug that has since been fixed in xNVSE.
<br />[/color]
<br />
<br />[color=#ff8f00][size=5][u]What this Does[/u][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[color=#c9daf8] This library completely replaces the game's heap management system with a faster implementation. Every object in game needs to exist somewhere in memory, this library dictates where each object is placed and how those objects are freed. It outperforms the game's outdated heap and thus has quite large performance gains, though perhaps not significant in vanilla New Vegas. 
<br />[/color]
<br />
<br />[color=#ff8f00][size=5][u]Thanks[/u][/size][/color]

<br />[color=#c9daf8]Firstly, I would like to thank [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/4995023][color=#22bbff]Nukem[/color][/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/4716447][color=#22bbff]jazzisparis[/color][/url] for their "d3dx9_38.dll" library proxy, starting project and advice along the way.
<br />[/color]
<br />[color=#c9daf8]Secondly, to all the testers who helped make this possible. [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/7481963][color=#22bbff]RoyBatty[/color][/url] play tested for hours on end in order to get the first stages of the heap going and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/54235967][color=#22bbff]Kormákur[/color][/url] for assistance and stress testing intensive scenarios. Thank you [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/5605673][color=#22bbff]tgspy[/color][/url] for consistently testing the latest versions and for sending countless NVAC logs.

No More Trippin and Bear Traps 2.1.0
====================================================
By Migck for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[center][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][color=#ff7700][size=6][b]No More Trippin' &amp; Bear Traps![/b][/size][/color][/font]
<br />
<br />[size=4][u][b]REQUIRES[/b][/u]
<br />ALL (major) DLC
<br />[url=http://nvse.silverlock.org]NVSE[/url]
<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277]JIP LN[/url][/size][/center]
<br />[size=3][u][size=5][b]No more Trippin'[/b][/size][/u]
<br />Upgraded all of the scripts used by the various tripwires, bear traps, pressure plates... anything that referenced the Light Step perk. These traps work with trigger boxes which unfortunately can be perfectly triggered by any creature no matter if it has the 'flying' flag set... the utility of this flag escapes me currently. They also are limited in that only the player can hold the Light Step perk in normal circumstances, so his companions are boned in that regard.
<br />
<br />Mines and the like don't use scripts, their explosive behavior is controlled by the engine and the only way to prevent their detonation timer from triggering is through perk entry points, so again not even flying creatures are safe from them. And it stands to reason, since being able to use Pulse Mines against hostile Mr Gutsies is nice. However, this mod also handles this.
<br />
<br />Trap scripts will not trigger for ANY creature that has the flying flag set, so ED-E and Sergeant RL-3 will be able to hover over them safely. NPCs will not trigger traps either if they have ownership of it through their id or factions, nor will companions trigger traps of which you're the owner. A perk is also added to the companion list preventing any of your flying companions from triggering mines, kinda as a buff to them.
<br />Some mods like [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61592]JSawyer Ultimate[/url] already prevent all companions from triggering mines anyways, since their AI has no way to handle them under normal circumstances. This mod does so too when you have the Light Step perk, or the In My Footsteps companion perk when God accompanies you in Dead Money. This represents you telling them where to mind their step, which is just logical IMO (and besides it's God the one telling you supposedly!), having either of these perks also prevent you and all your companions from triggering any of the scripted traps, so that you can merrily romp into every mousetrap.
<br />
<br />Scripts were altered taking [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51664]YUP[/url] as the base, greatly simplifying them as there's no more need for endless checks of factions and dummy weapons. The scripts themselves are still somewhat of a format mess, but hey, if it works, don't touch it. It should be easy to patch the function they now call when triggered by an actor to give additional features/requisites if necessary.
<br />
<br />Two new global values affect how traps are triggered:
<br />[/size][list]
<br />[*][size=3][color=#ff0000][u][b]TripTrapNoUnlivingTrigger[/b][/u][/color] controls whether traps can be triggered by anything that's not a living, moving actor. So as to avoid what I view as an exploit by moving an object or corpse over the trap to trigger. It is enabled by default, to use vanilla behavior, type [b]'[size=3]set TripTrapNoUnlivingTrigger[/size] to 0'[/b] in the console.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3][color=#ff0000][u][b]TripTrapNoHitTrigger[/b][/u][/color] controls whether traps can be triggered by shooting at them or by nearby explosions. Again, to avoid what I view as exploits so that disabling a trap relies a bit more on your actual skills. To use vanilla behavior, type [b]'set TripTrapNoHitTrigger to 0'[/b] in the console.[/size]
<br />[/list][size=3]
<br />Plus, experience from disarming traps has been somewhat corrected to use a custom function and all the globals for it, you're guaranteed to receive at least 2 XP no matter how easy the trap is to disarm.
<br />
<br />[size=5][b][u]Bear Traps![/u][/b][/size]
<br />Because I had to patch all traps' scripts, which included bear traps ones, I figured I ought to provide for mods which make placeable bear traps possible, well, namely for the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34977]Bear Traps[/url] mod by Suuk.
<br />Bear traps' workings have been upgraded all across the line, so they now work like actual weapons. Well, more or less. You can now choose to pick up any [u]non-persistent[/u], sprung bear traps, which will add them to your inventory as a mine-type weapon.[size=3] Bear traps are considered a Melee Weapon, with a skill requirement of 55 and a STR requirement of 6 by default[/size]. Do note that you need a Repair skill of at least 23 to disarm an armed bear trap, and you need to meet those requirements in order to rearm it.
<br />
<br />Bear traps don't actually have a proper projectile, since the bear trap itself lacks collision ([b]NOTE[/b]: if someone can provide a proper collidable bear trap model, I'm all ears, especially if it comes with some 'gyro' system to make it always fall pointing upwards). When firing a bear trap weapon, a new bear trap will be placed directly under your feet. If you don't meet its requirements, it will spawn sprung and you won't be able to arm it. And remember you also need a Repair skill of 23 to disarm them, even if you placed them yourself!
<br />
<br />Your armed bear traps follow the same trap rules as other traps described above, and are owned by you, so they won't be a hazard for you or your companions (in most circumstances). A triggered bear trap causes a base 50 melee damage which ignores DT &amp; DR, has a whooping x10 limb damage multiplier almost guaranteeing a crippled leg or two, and causes massive bleeding on non-robotic targets over 20 seconds. The bleeding can be removed easily with the application of any kind of Stimpak, but if you lack those, be prepared to lose upwards of 200 HP AND fatigue, which may even end up with you knocked out cold while bleeding to death if you trigger several traps successively.
<br />
<br />The Hunter perk, which I otherwise viewed as kinda weaksauce, has been upgraded to also affect bear traps you place. With this perk, chances are high that whoever steps on your bear traps will also be knocked down.
<br />
<br />Bear traps have limited durability and are damaged every time they are triggered, or otherwise receive damage of any kind. While you can't see their condition changing in your inventory (due to being mines), the mod tracks the condition of your placed and picked up traps. Broken bear traps are visually distinguishable, and can be scraped for some random scrap metal. Bear traps can also be made and scrapped at the workbench with a Repair skill of 23 and scrap metal. And finally, they do have a very weak point. I'll let you figure it out 4 you power gamers.
<br />
<br />
<br />Drop 'TripTrap.esp' in your Data folder to install, trash it to uninstall. Nothing to do about bear traps you decided to remove from the world, sorry![/size]

CozyMotelRoomMod 1.0.0
====================================================
By krimsons for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

Howdy pardners! Novac has always been my favorite town but I never liked the Courier's motel room. This is my first mod and the goal was to make player's home cleaner and cozier, so that it has the same vibe of an old motel room but now with a feeling that someone's been living there for awhile, but nothing too fancy. I tried making it faction neutral and lore-friendly as well. Hope you enjoy my mod!
<br />
<br />Features:
<br />
<br />[list]
<br />[*]None of the original constrainers were removed, so if you had anything stashed before installing the mod it should still be in place. New containers added as well.
<br />[*]New kitchenette with a cooking station.
<br />[*]New window that matches the outside one better. It was a personal pet peeve :,) The window light changes according to the time of day.
<br />[*]Working radio tuned to Radio New Vegas.
<br />[*]Bathroom-turned-workshop with a crafting bench (and less gross sink and toilet).
<br />[/list]I would suggest to not pick up decor/ammo/food placed around as it will make the surrounding clutter move as well (tis a bethesda game after all).
<br />
<br />Dead Money DLC required for electric hot plate to work!
<br />
<br />[b]Upd. [/b]There's a known issue with fridge and safe not keeping their position, if it happens download the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/70566/?tab=files]Fridge and safe fix[/url] file instead!

<br />[b]
<br />[BASIC DESCRIPTION]
<br />[/b]You can now attack a group of people without gaining infamy, but if a witness of the same faction survives to tell the tale, you will be met with infamy.
<br />
<br />[b][DETAILED DESCRIPTION][/b]
<br />[list]
<br />[*]If you antagonize a group of people and then flee but didn't kill anybody, you will gain no infamy.
<br />[*]If you kill somebody in that group of people and then flee, you will gain some infamy.
<br />[*]If you kill everybody in that group leaving behind no witnesses, you will gain no infamy.
<br />[*]If they report you murdering somebody then the whole faction will be hostile to you for 24 in-game hours, if your reputation title is Villified then they will hate you 24/7.
<br />[*]If a witness has gained enough distance from the player (About the range of the actor fade setting on max) you will have 30 seconds before the witness spreads the word of your hostility.
<br />[/list]

<br /> the dialogue that makes him hostile.

<br />stats maxed out when you complete Lonesome Road.
<br />-Most of the faction modifications are now done through script, this is to allow for better compatibility with other mods.[/i]
<br />[/spoiler][u]

Pipboy Readius - New Vegas Edition
Version: 1.1.0
Date: November 10, 2010
Category: Models and Textures
Requirements: NVSE Beta 2 or higher, Ability to Read
Authors: AlexScorpion and Brianide

[size=\"5\"][b][color=\"red\"][u]I AM SPECTACULARLY STUPID (NOV. 10, 2010)[/u]
The last upload contained the old ESP. The new upload contains the new one. Let\'s all pretend that this little incident did not transpire and overlook the fact that I am a complete ass.[/color]

[color=\"orange\"][u]UPDATE (NOV. 10, 2010)[/u]
The new version requires NVSE Beta 2 or higher. If you do not have NVSE or do not have Beta 2 or higher, please [url=\"http://nvse.silverlock.org/\"]get it here[/url].

Also, FOV options have been added to the mod options, accessible via the [Pip-Boy Readius Options] aid item.

The armor repair glitch should be corrected now. Thanks to Antistar for recommending a working fix.

Finally, the models, textures, and other resources are now packed into a BSA file. Users upgrading from version 1.00 can delete the following files, as they are no longer necessary, though leaving them should not cause issues:
FILE meshes\\characters\\_1stperson\\locomotion\\male\\pipboy.kf
FILE meshes\\characters\\_1stperson\\locomotion\\female\\pipboyfemale.kf
FOLDER meshes\\scorptech

== Description ==

This is the official port of the Pipboy Readius mod from Fallout 3. It replaces the regular ingame Pipboy with a handheld Readius-like device. It also removes the default Pipboy from the player\'s arm, as well as the accompanying glove.



== Differences from Fallout 3 Version ==

- [b][u]Controllers work.[/u][/b] This is something we received [b]a lot[/b] of complaints about in Fallout 3. Credit for this is mostly due to Vivanto, so you should all express your gratitude by appropriating him his deserved kudos (see Credits section at bottom for link).
- The Pip-Boy light is no longer remapped. There is now an Aid item \"[Pip-Boy Readius Options]\" which can be used to access the uninstallation menu, should the need arise.



== Installation ==

1.) Extract the files to a temporary location.
2.) Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.
3.) Copy files to (install folder)\\Fallout3\\Data\\
4.) Start the Fallout New Vegas launcher, click Data, and place a checkmark beside Readius_NV.esp.



== Uninstallation ==

This is currently a rather unpleasant task; it\'ll be better automated when a suitable mod manager exists.

1.) Open the mod options menu and choose the \"Uninstall Mod\" option.
2.) Reequip your armor, save, and quit.
3.) Deactivate Readius_NV.ESP.
4.) Optionally, delete Readius_NV.ESP and Readius_NV.BSA.
5.) Load the save and play as normal.



== Known Issues ==

- The Readius does not appear in your hand until your hand stops moving. Hoping to fix in the near future.
- Rarely, ironsights will temporarily fail to appear. Opening and closing the Pip-Boy menu seems to fix this. Still trying to isolate the cause of this one.



== Version History ==

v.1.1.0	- Fixed the NVSE check notification so that it properly antagonizes users who have neglected to install it
	- Fixed armor repair bug (thanks, Antistar)
	- Added ability to change FOV distance via ingame options
	- Packed resource files into a BSA archive to ease of (un)installation

v.1.0.0	- Initial release

Oxmod 1.0.0
====================================================
By Ullyuxtun for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

This is my own personal game mod, with balance changes based on Jsawyer Mod, but with a lot of my own changes/additions and built with YUP in mind. (Just to be clear, the level cap is still 50 in Oxmod.)
<br />
<br />I decided to make this because even though I like a lot about Jsawyer, I want to minimize conflicts and balance issues with modded content (including the aforementioned YUP).
<br />
<br />This mod requires the Yukigachi Unofficial Patch. If you don't want to use the patch, then just use Sawyer mod instead.

Perk Styled CCC Icons 1.1 1.1.0
====================================================
By TheKraken for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/50468]JIP Companions Command and Control[/url] is an excellent mod for wrangling your followers. But there's an issue in it that has always bothered me. The icons. Low resolution, odd fov and unnatural colors make them look just awful. Not to mention that they look out of place since they are full colors. This mod replaces them with perk styled versions that fit the rest of the UI much better.
<br />
<br />[b]FAQ[/b]
<br />    Q: What icons are covered by this mod?
<br />    A: Base game, All DLC, TTW, Frontier, The Storyteller and Velius.
<br />    Q: Will you make an icon for *mod*?
<br />    A: If I personally use it or find it interesting I might get around to making a icon for said mod's followers.
<br />
<br />[b]Special Thanks:[/b]
<br />This mod simply wouldn't exist without ItsMeJesusHChrist's superb [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65046]Consistent Pip-Boy Icons[/url] and it's sources.

Perks Day Tripper and Chemist Survivalist Style Fix 1.5.0
====================================================
By CivisRomanus for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

Requires main game along with Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues and Lonesome Road.
<br />--------------------------
<br />Mod version: 1.5
<br />--------------------------
<br />[i][b]"The devil is in the detail."[/b][/i]
<br />--------------------------
<br />As you probably (already) knew, [b]food and healing items[/b] are also [b]affected[/b], if you have [b]Day Tripper[/b] and [b]Chemist[/b] perks.
<br />For example, with high survival skill (&gt;=70) a single Bloatfly Slider heals you ~320 HP, if you have both perks.
<br />[b]No siree. [/b]Quite absurd to heal 320HP using only 1 measly food item, being also pumped up with chems that grant you 110 AP, &gt; +56% damage and 50% Damage Resistance.There should be[b][b] some [/b][/b]consequences, if you like chems[b][b].
<br />[/b][/b]--------------------------
<br />Although YUP dealt (somewhat) with the issue, they also introduced a lot of cumbersome modifications to chems, which made my heart sing [b]not[/b] like a wild thing.
<br />--------------------------
<br />[b]Short story[/b]:
<br />This mod reinstates the chems as creator intended and solves the problem in [b]Survivalist Style[/b] way. An intelligent one, that is.
<br />Food and healing items will no longer be affected by these 2 perks.
<br />--------------------------
<br />Warning:
<br />[b]Do not clean up the mod[/b]. You've been warned.
<br />---------------------------
<br />[list]
<br />[*]Implemented a new formula of calculating the health restored after the perks have been taken (added in [b]version 1.2[/b])
<br />[/list][list]
<br />[*]Removed increased max. health effect from [b]Thin/Thick Red Paste[/b], [b]Blood/Black Blood Sausage[/b] to eliminate a strange glitch in health calculation when you have very low health (&lt;10HP) and you heal with food items. To alleviate the extreme pain of removing such utterly useless effects, I added Restore Starvation in hardcore mode according to JSawyer tweaks for these items (40/80, 50/100). Restore Starvation will [b]not[/b] increase with your Survival level; Thin/Thick Red Paste, Blood/Black Blood Sausages are (strange) chems with healing properties, [b]not[/b] food items (added in [b]version 1.3[/b]). For more info, see (e.g.) http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Blood_sausage, section Bugs. That visual glitch was not entirely eliminated by YUP, it is still visible when you place these items in containers (or take them from a dead creature/NPC).
<br />[*]Psycho and Slasher +25% bonus damage will stack (+50% Dam. bonus, base weapon damage). Psycho +25% Dam. bonus will no longer disappear when 
<br />Slasher expires, even if (Psycho) is still active (added in [b]version 1.4[/b]).[/list]--------------------------
<br />New in version 1.5
<br />Bonus to my faithful users ([b]version 1.5 only[/b])
<br />[list]
<br />[*]Monocyte Breeder implant (Dr. Usanagi) more powerful. 0.5% total health/s instead of measly 1HP every 10s. Kind of Fallout 4 health regen out there.
<br />[*]Solar Powered Perk boosted. 0.5% total health/s instead of 1HP/s.
<br />[*]DLC03RadAbsorbScript corrected, Rad Absorption Perk more powerful. 0.5 Rad/s (rad absorption) instead of measly 1 Rad every 20s.
<br />[/list]
<br />Have fun.
<br />
<br />Credits:
<br />Bethesda/Obsidian.
<br />Fallout 4 health regeneration system.
<br />JSawyer mod.
<br />My way.
<br />The Appian Way.
<br />Via Egnatia.
<br />And last but not least...[b]The Beatles[/b].
<br />
<br />Many thanks to:
<br />Nexus - for allowing us posting all kind of ideas converted into mods and not only.

These items quickly accumulate and annoyingly clutter the inventory lists. You can&#39;t use them, there&#39;s no real reason to check which ones you have, and many linger in your inventory even after the associated quest is completed. Thus hiding them has no negative impact on gameplay in my opinion. The items are still in your inventory - you just can&#39;t see them.<br /><br />There may be a split second where the items are visible when switching to the Misc tab before they disappear - unfortunately this is unavoidable, but it&#39;s rarely noticeable.[/size]<br /><br />[line]<br />[color=#fff2cc][size=5][b]Installation[/b][/size][/color]<br /><br />[size=3]This mod requires:[/size]<br />[list]<br />[*][size=3][url=http://nvse.silverlock.org/]New Vegas Script Extender[/url];[/size]<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277/?]JIP LN NVSE Plugin[/url].[/size]<br />[/list]<br /><br />[size=3]Ensure you&#39;re using up-to-date versions of both.[/size]<br /><br />[line]<br />[color=#fff2cc][size=5][b]Uninstallation[/b][/size][/color]<br /><br />[size=3]Before uninstalling this mod, make sure that the last inventory tab you viewed was not Misc.[/size]<br /><br />[size=3]Failing to do this will mean all quest items are hidden permanently.

Rex The Cat 1.0.0
====================================================
By rainman2010 for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

CREDITS and PERMISSION:<br />Thanks to the Beyond Boulder team for letting me upload their meshes and textures.<br />They aren&#39;t my work so you have to get permission from them to use the files.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Rex the Cat turns the robot dog companion Rex into a cat.<br />I only changed Rex&#39;s appearance model, audio template and dialogue.  His fighting stats, etc were not changed.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />There is also an optional file with 3 simple cats in Doc Mitchell&#39;s House in Goodsprings.  The 3 cats have different strength, size, and ferociousness.  You can tell each one seperately to follow or wait.  The Cat Followers don&#39;t need Rex The Cat, but you will need the meshes and textures folders from the main download.  See the readme in the file for more info. <br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The optional file now contains 3 more colors (see picture) that Rex can be changed to by renaming the cat.dds texture file with a copy of one of the new files.  Also the Cat Followers can now be different colors from Rex and each other.    The readme in the optional file contains instructions on renaming the textures to get the color you want, it&#39;s pretty simple.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />All of the Meshes and Textures for the cat were created by The Beyond Boulder Dome Team and they gave me permission to upload them. <br /><br />Check out the Beyond Boulder Dome mod:<br /><br />http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/46907/<br /><br />Top notch voice work, huge worldspace, lots of quests, and some cool unique items and encounters (like coming across a kitty&#33;)  <br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />INSTALLING:<br />To install, just unzip and copy the folders and .esp file to the game&#39;s Data folder.  If you already have Beyond Boulder Dome, you don&#39;t need to copy over the meshes and textures but it won&#39;t hurt anything if you overwrite them.<br /><br />CONFLICTS:<br />This mod will obviously conflict with any other mod that changes Rex&#39;s appearance.<br />It may also conflict with mods that change Companion behavior and dialogue.<br /><br />I tested it with Follower Home Marker and it worked fine as long as RexTheCat is higher in the load order.<br /><br />I also tried it with Improved Companion Sandbox, and it seemed to work if RexTheCat is lower in the load order.<br /><br />If Rex doesn&#39;t appear as a cat, you probably have a conflict and need to mess with the load order.<br /><br />CREDITS and PERMISSION:<br />Thanks to the Beyond Boulder team for letting me upload their meshes and textures.<br />They aren&#39;t my work so you have to get permission from them to use the files.<br /><br />Thanks also to Quetzlsacatanango for the Q Simple Follower base model that I used on the optional Cat Follower.

Rusted Roboscorpions - Worn 1.0.0
====================================================
By polferrera for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[list]
<br />[/list]As my Unique Think Tank Members mod, this started as a retexture for my personal use, as I've never found any Roboscorpion retextures, but, tbh, I'm just releasing this because of my gf's insistence (bless you Su)
<br />
<br />[b]What this mod does (as in v.1.0)[/b]
<br />
<br />Gives you [b]THREE [/b]different looks for your favorite sting-happy enemies:
<br />
<br />[b]-WORN[/b] - For those who like the vanilla look but want some proof that these adorable critters have been roaming Big MT for a while
<br />
<br />[b]-GREASY[/b] - More rusty, greasy looking. For those who want to go to the Sink's Sink and sink all that dirt down
<br />
<br />[b]-RUSTED STEEL[/b] - For those who like an alternative to the over the top colors vanilla offers
<br />
<br />[b]What this mod doesn't do:[/b]
<br />
<br />-Give Muggy's existence meaning
<br />-Get you a better job
<br />-Make the pain go away. Why won't the pain go away.
<br />
<br />[b]INSTALLATION:[/b]
<br />
<br />Use your prefered mod manager to install or download manually and drag and drop the files into your Data folder

Details<br />=======<br />This mod contains:<br />   - 21 new quests.<br />   - 2 fully voiced companions.<br />   - Loads of (mostly) voiced characters.<br />   - over 700 lines of voiced dialogue.<br />   - several new locations.<br />   - and a few more things.<br /><br />For a list of all the quest and how to start them check the readme, or just get out there and find them on your own.<br /><br />The quests in the mod are mostly fairly small things; the idea behind it was to simply add some new side-quests for the player to do, I was getting bored of always doing the same stuff over and over in every new game I start, that&#39;s partly why I made it.<br />Ideally this should be installed when starting a new game; it&#39;s not absolutely necessary, but if you don&#39;t you&#39;ll probably find some of the quests really easy.<br /><br />At the moment not all the characters are voiced; but will be finished in updates.<br /><br />I plan to update this mod with new content as often as possible, I have loads of ideas that I never included in this release; mostly due to time constraints and the fact that I was getting bored of it for the time being.<br /><br />I&#39;m sorry about the terrible description, I really can&#39;t think of anything more to write. <br /><br />Credits<br />=======<br />Me (Saxxon91)<br />TheFourthHorse - Rugged Race - http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/48629/?

<br />-Unlike the other two mods I saw that did this same thing, my mod forwards YUP's fixes.
<br />This one could easily be better than mine, though: https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61525 .

<br />[/b]-Not compatible with TTW (but TTW does this already anyways).
<br />-Not compatible with anything else that would overwrite the scripts this messes with.
<br />-Won't apply to non-vanilla instances of your items being taken away (you could ask for standalone patches, if you'd like).

SmoothLight v1 1.0.0
====================================================
By HunterZ for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

UPDATE 2:
SmoothLight looking a bit dim at night with weather/brightness/lighting mods? Try SuperLight for an effective \"high beam\" mode: http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/48369


UPDATE:
Wish you could use SmoothLight with Fallout 3 too? Well, ma1025 has made your wish come true by porting it over: http://fallout3.nexusmods.com/mods/18389

Thanks, ma1025!


Summary:
SmoothLight v1

Changes the Pip-Boy light:
- Increases magnitude (distance) from 15 to 45 to illuminate a greater area.
- Decreases fade (brightness) from 1.2 to 0.55 to reduce HDR dampening effects.
- Changes color from subtle green to subtle halogen amber for a warmer, more natural lighting effect.

No other mods required.

Notes:
There are many Pip-Boy light mods available, and I tried several. Unfortunately, I found that most did as much harm as good because they increased the light\'s brightness in addition to the distance; this caused the game\'s HDR lighting system to dampen other nearby lights to the point that I couldn\'t see very well beyond the Pip-Boy\'s range. My first attempt at playing with the GECK, this mod increases the distance of the Pip-Boy light while somewhat proportionally *decreasing* its brightness; this causes it to more subtly illuminate a reasonably larger area, with the intention of filling in nearby darkness without drowning out other light sources so that you can still see things a bit further away too.

While I was at it, I decided to also change the color to something more natural/warm than the default green glow. I believe I ended up using a value derived from the halogen color at http://planetpixelemporium.com/tutorialpages/light.html

This mod is likely to be mutually exclusive with other Pip-Boy light mods that affect distance/brightness/color.

Installation:
Install HZSmoothLight.esp into the game\'s Data folder and activate it via whatever method you are using for other mods.

Load order shouldn\'t matter, unless you\'re using something else that affects the Pip-Boy light.

Steal loose 1 Karma 1.0.0
====================================================
By Reveurrr for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

The purpose of this mod is to keep a malus for stealing, without getting hudge penalties.
To me, it\'s not realistic to have a very evil karma when you helped everybody in the Wasteland.

Now stealing gets you a malus of -1 Karma instead of -5 Karma.
Enjoy :)

Subtle Camera Motion 1.0.0
====================================================
By Hitman47101 for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[size=4][u][b]Description[/b][/u][/size]
<br />
<br />The motion of the camera found in the 1st person animations in this game is overdone and far too strong, you lose out on detail in the anims due to the near motion sickness inducing screen waving, it can make combat feel disorientating and in some cases throw off your aim. However you can't just remove it without amplifying the feeling that you're just a floating camera without weight instead of a person, so I reanimated the camera in (nearly) all the animations from scratch. 
<br />
<br />This mod also fixes a handful of animation bugs I found while I was working.
<br />
<br />The results are best seen in game or in video, so check out the video section or just try the mod out and see if it's for you. 
<br />
<br />[b][u][size=4]FAQs:[/size][/u][/b]
<br />
<br />[b]Someone:[/b] Is this compatible with X?
<br />
<br />[b]Me:[/b] This mod is incompatible with the following animation mods:
<br />
<br />Weapon Animation Replacer WAR (Only partially incompatible, don't install any of its 1st person anims and you're good to go.) 
<br />1st Person Weapon Animation Overhaul
<br />Weapon Animation Replacers - Enhanced Camera compatibility pack
<br />Asurah Reanimation Pack
<br />Remove Camera Movements from 1st Person Animations
<br />
<br />Everything else should be compatible, no I can't/won't make a version compatible with any of those, one set of anims was enough work already.  
<br />
<br />[b]Someone:[/b] Why did you make this mod?
<br />
<br />[b]Me:[/b] I wanted to play Fallout 3 via TTW but the camera motion was annoying me, as it was much worse overall  in the animations that came from F3, so I used some of the tricks I picked up while animating for F4 and fixed it.
<br />
<br />[b]Someone:[/b] Why not use an existing animation mod like everyone else?
<br />
<br />[b]Me:[/b] I don't like any of them.
<br />
<br />[b]Someone:[/b] Even yours?
<br />
<br />[b]Me:[/b] Especially mine. 
<br />
<br />[size=4][b][u]Installation:[/u][/b][/size]
<br />
<br />Installs like any other mod, manually or using a mod manager, I recommend the later for easy uninstallation.
<br />
<br />While it's not a hard requirement, I strongly recommend ether using the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65052]Weapon Mesh Improvement Mod[/url] By RoyBatterian, or A Tale of Two Wastelands (TTW) by the TTW Team (Not both). I built this mod off of their fixed animations so for the best possible experience you should use them as well, plus its handy if you actually want to hit stuff with certain guns.
<br />[u][b][size=4]
<br />Uninstallation:[/size][/b][/u]
<br />
<br />Installation in reverse.
<br />
<br />[u][b]Credits &amp; Thanks[/b][/u]
<br />
<br />RoyBatterian &amp; Mindboggles for advice and the fixed vanilla animations that I used as base for this mod and all my future mods. 
<br />Bethesda and Obsidian for Fallout New Vegas. 
<br />Hitman47101 for the rest.
<br />
<br />This mod is dedicated to the best bunch of Pepe-lovin, Dicaprio-sniggering manic obsessives around, you know who you are, with love friends.  
<br />
<br />[size=1]Final note, this took too long to make. [/size]

SunnyCompanion 0.0.0-
====================================================
By gurk_meja for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

------------------
SunnyCompanion 2.6
------------------

You know she\'s too good for Goodsprings! 
Yes that\'s right, Sunny Smiles is now ready to share your adventures in the wasteland. 
 

What is this mod?
-----------------
Sunny Smiles is now a fully featured companion,
with voice and lip-sync.   

She behaves and talks like any normal companion,
and with some added options.
Cheyenne is available as an optional companion as well!

Her look and scripting is vanilla, and those that have tried my earlier companions know that\'s how I like it.  
This mod is designed for maximum compatibility and stability.

IMPORTANT
---------
To hire Sunny you must have completed the Goodsprings quest, Ghost Town Gunfight.  
If you killed/let her be killed, obviously you won\'t be able to hire her at all.  
You also need to pass a fairly easy speech check, or have the LadyKiller perk.

Features
--------
* Companion Wheel
* No companion limit
* Default waiting mode is Sandbox, guard is an option 
* SetEssential Toggle in Tactics Dialogue
* Unlimited Weapon Toggle
* Set home, go home

Notes about Cheyenne
-------------------- 
* Cheyenne is not a standalone follower, she will always follow Sunny, NOT you.
If you are looking for a standalone dog companion, look elsewhere.
* All relevant CompanionWheel Commands are available. 
You can tell her to Wait, Change Follow Distance and Aggression with with the wheel.
For obvious reasons changing combat style has no effect.
* If you tell Sunny to wait, Cheyenne will wait by her side.
* If you fire Sunny, Cheyenne will leave with her, and join you again if you hire her again.
* If Sunny is killed Cheyenne will leave you forever.
* If you change the essential flag on Sunny, Cheyenne will also be essential.
* If you set Cheyenne to follow long distance she uses a different AI-package (accompany).
Try it out and let me know which you like best (long or short).
* You can only change if Cheyenne is a follower or not when you are hiring inside the Prospector saloon.

OBS! I strongly recommend installing the dog eye fix for Cheyenne,
if you are disturbed by eyes floating i the air. Get it at:  
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35012 

Compatibility
-----------
Any mod that changes Sunny Smiles has the potential to mess with this mod. 
If you have problems getting her to follow it\'s almost certain you have a conflicting mod.
As always, if you have problems, first try to load this mod after any of the interfering mods.

What is changed?
Sunny Smiles (AI,dialogue,scripts,some stats), 
Cheyenne (AI,dialogue,scripts,some stats).
Added a teleport marker in GSProspectorSaloonInterior 
No existing companions or their scripts have been modified.
All her involvement in existing quests will work as normal.

Known issues
------------
I haven\'t tested her extensively, I know there will be problems with equipment in casinos and such, 
the Ultra Luxe is especially troublesome because it can trap modded companions like this one.  
Just leave her outside of places like that if you want to be safe.

The \"passive\" mode on the CompanionWheel does not work - the default companions also have the same issue.
There\'s simply no easy way to fix this without really messy scripting.

Installation
------------
To install:
Simply unpack the 7zip-file in your game folder, or use a mod manager.

To uninstall:
Fire Sunny back to the Saloon.
delete SunnyCompanion.esp
and all voice files in <game folder>\\Data\\sound\\Voice\\SunnyCompanion.esp

To upgrade:
To upgrade from 1.x to 2.x you must follow these steps.
1. Remove and store any items from her inventory that you want to keep. 
2. Travel to Goodsprings.
3. Fire Sunny, save, and exit the game.
3. Delete the entire mod including soundfiles.
4. Load the game and save again (without the mod), exit game.
5. Install the new version, and load the game.
6. Go to the Prospector Saloon and hire her again.

Legal
----- 
You don\'t have to ask permission to release your own modifications based on this, 
but do give proper credit where it is deserved. Drop me a message if you like anyway, it\'s fun to know where this is used.  

News in update 1.1
-----------------
* Added teleport script to ensure she reaches the location when you fire her
* Toggle Unlimited Weapon also toggles CompanionAmmo
* Removed weight from companion weapon 
* Removed fire weapon comments if she\'s hired

News in update 2.0
-----------------
* Cheyenne is now available as companion! Read the details above.  
* Independent HomeMarker, you can now set a home anywhere you want.
You have three options for her to go when you fire her, Goodsprings, Lucky38 or Home.
* The wheel actually changes aggression now, 
(Not that I have noticed any real effect on the AI behavior, 
maybe that\'s why they didn\'t bother to implement this on the original companions)
* Fixed: Missing OpenTeamMateContainer from one random response
* Added Cherchez La Femme option when hiring 
* Added new sounds for new dialogue and replaced some old sounds
* OBS! FOLLOW THE UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER!

News in update 2.1
-----------------
* Adjusted Cheyennes health to be more in line with other companions. 
If you are upgrading from 2.0 you only need to replace the esp, otherwise follow the upgrade instructions.

News in update 2.2
-----------------
* Added dialogue to change whether Cheyenne should follow or not when you rehire Sunny. This new dialogue is only available in the Prospector Saloon in Goodsprings,(i.e. if Sunny has been fired with the option that sends her to Goodsprings). Before your could only make that choice once.
* Now Sunny is removed from GoodspringsFactions upon hiring, and only get her factions back if fired to the Prospector Saloon.
* Fix: Cheyenne would get a companion wheel when hiring Sunny for a second time, even if you chose to only hire Sunny before.
* Fix: Cheyenne would still follow you when fasttraveling if you only told Sunny to wait, now both will stay. 
* Sunny and Cheyenne now comes with with their own unique perks.
Sunny has Survivalist Expert that increase your survival skill by 10.
Cheyenne has a perk \"The Dog Trick\" that increases your charisma by 1.
Note: If you are upgrading from 2.x it\'s sufficient to install it by overwriting all the files in this mod, otherwise follow the upgrade instructions. To get the new perks if Sunny is already hired you\'ll have to fire and rehire Sunny.

News in update 2.3
------------------
* Fixed: Sunny could become hostile, if fired while set to \"be aggressive\" with the wheel.
* Added dialogue option to turn off the new perks if you don\'t want them.
it\'s under the same tactics menu as the other toggles.
Note: If you are upgrading from 2.x it\'s sufficient to install it by overwriting all the files in this mod, 
otherwise follow the upgrade instructions. You may have to use the dialogue to turn the perks on again if she\'s already hired.

News in update 2.4
------------------
* Fix: A existing dialoge topic was changed by mistake.
* Fix: Sunny should now be properly marked as ally when hired (this does not change combat behaviour in any way)
Note: If you are upgrading from 2.x it\'s sufficient to install it by overwriting the files in this mod.
If Sunny is already hired you\'ll have to fire and rehire Sunny for her to become flagged as ally.

News in update 2.5
------------------
* Fix: The Top Level flag was removed from the FollowersTactics topic by mistake.

News in update 2.6
------------------
* Fix: Yet another dialoge bug, topic 0015D7F9 was modified by mistake,
it could cause the hire topic to not appear (in combination with some other mods).

The Mod Configuration Menu 1.5.0
====================================================
By Pelinor for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

The Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) is a resource for other mods to use which adds a \"Mod Configuration\" button to the Pause menu.
When you click on it, a window appears with a list of all of the mods using MCM. Each of these listed mods are then configured from within the same menu.

As can be seen in the screenshots, a very user-friendly menu allows you to quickly and confidently configure your mods. You won\'t have to use any items or press any special keys to use it.

For modders wanting to use MCM menus for their mods, a detailed guide is given explaining how.

Mods using MCM only require MCM to be installed and activated to use the menu; there is no master dependency to the system, so your mod will still work if the user doesn\'t have MCM installed.

(Note: The Mod Configuration Menu is not to be redistributed with mods using it. Please provide a link to this page for users to acquire it.)

[*]Q. MCM tells me to remove redundant XML lines. How do I do this?

[*]Q. Will MCM be made for Fallout 3?
[*]A. Probably not. FOSE doesn\'t have the capabilities of NVSE that make MCM easily possible.

[*]Q. Why do none of my other MCM mods show up, even though I have Project Nevada installed with integrated MCM?
[*]A. You need to use the stand-alone MCM. The integrated Project Nevada version only works for that mod.

[*]Q. What do I do when my menu look weird after I updated Project Nevada to version 2.3?
[*]A. Update your MCM to the official version 1.2 or higher.

[*]Q. What do I do when I can\'t select mods that are at the bottom of the mod list?
[*]A. Install the MCM BugFix 1 file. Overwrite the existing plugin with the contents of that file.

The Moon Comes Over The Tower - Restored 1.1.0
====================================================
By MattyFez for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[color=#e69138][size=2][b]Overview[/b][/size][/color]<br />[color=#efefef]<br />[/color][size=2][color=#f4f4f4]This quest in the vanilla game is extremely short. On the doorstep of the Lucky 38 is Emily Ortal and she asks you to bug a terminal. You walk into the casino, bug the terminal as asked, and walk out. However, this quest has a missing part which requires you to go H&H Tools Factory, Camp Golf, and North Vegas Steel, and disable the network encryption. This mod aims to restore that stage. It also gives the player a reason to explore locations like H&H Tools Factory and North Vegas Steel since they aren&#39;t used in any other quests. [/color]<br /><br />[color=#e69138][b]Installation[/b][/color]<br />[color=#f4f4f4]<br />Ideally, you should be using a mod manager such as Mod Organizer to handle the downloading and installation of this mod. Once you have it downloaded, you need to double click the mod from the &#34;Downloads&#34; tab, and press OK.[/color]<br /><br />[size=3][b][color=#e69138][size=2]Manual Installation[/size][/color]<br />[/b][/size][/size][color=#f4f4f4]<br />Extract the file called &#34;TMCOTT - Restored.esp&#34; from the zip archive, and move it into Fallout New Vegas&#92;Data directory. Ensure you enable it from the launcher before starting the game. Uninstallation is as easy as deleting the &#34;TMCOTT - Restored.esp&#34; file.[/color]<br /><br />[color=#e69138][b]Bugs and Issues<br /><br />[/b][/color][color=#f4f4f4]Please report them in the Bugs section.[/color]<br /><br />[color=#e69138][size=2][b]Version History<br />[color=#f4f4f4]<br />[/color][/b][/size][/color][color=#f4f4f4]v1.0 - Initial release.[/color]<br />v1.1 - Edited Emily Ortal&#39;s subtitles and Anthony House&#39;s terminal entries to reflect YUP fixes.

The Professional Fix - All Criticals x1.2 1.2.0
====================================================
By CivisRomanus for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

Requires main game only.
<br />--------------------------------
<br />You have two versions of the perk:
<br />1. The "purist" version - as the creator intended - checks correctly if the target has detected the player and uses the animation type of the 1H pistols (for missing pistols or 1H SMGs) and the original list for 2H SMGs. 
<br />Only Sneak Critical Attacks will be boosted by 20%.
<br />2. The boosted version - All Critical Attacks will be boosted by 20% if you use any 1H pistols/SMGs or 2H SMGs included by the creator in the original list.
<br />3. Due to the improved conditions of the perk, both versions will work with any 1H pistol/SMG (even a custom-created one) that "walks" across the Nevada desert.
<br />
<br />Both versions of the perk will work extremely well in conjunction with Light Touch perk - the SMGs (silenced or not) will be particularly boosted (higher chance per shot to score critical hits).
<br />
<br />New in version 1.2 - Boosted version
<br />Increased a bit Guns and Energy Weapons skills requirements (35 -&gt; 45). They were a bit low in version 1.1, if you have the trait Skilled.
<br />No real need for 70 Sneak since all Critical Attacks will be boosted.
<br />
<br />Have fun.
<br />-------------------------------
<br />The new weapons from DLCs are added to the original TheProfessionalWeaponsList via the next scripts:
<br />NVDLC02MQ00Script
<br />NVDLC03MQ00SCRIPT
<br />NVDLC04MQ00SCRIPT
<br />NVDLC05MQ00SCRIPT
<br />...so any mod that manually modifies the original list with DLCs weapons will glitch the vanilla scripts if you uninstall that mod (see Posts section).

====================================================

[center]Recolour Redux of the Cazadores.[/center]
<br />
<br />This mod recolours the creatures known as Cazadores found in the Wasteland, there are several options.
<br />This affects all Cazadores found in the base game including Old World Blues and even mods that make use of them, such as -
<br />[list]
<br />[*]A Cazadore's Life by Hopper31 (will affect SergeantButtFist of Alchestbreach fame)
<br />[*]Cazauntlet by Hopper31
<br />[*]Cazaclaws by MissMorose
<br />[/list]
<br />Manually download the file and to install it, drop the contents into your Fallout New Vegas folder.

<br />
<br />Notes -
<br />[list]
<br />[*]If the mod is too 'shiny' in game with your visual setup, try deleting the _n file.
<br />[*]As mentioned this recolour should apply to any mods that make use of the Cazador creature.
<br />[*]Choose from - [b]Rainbow Soft/Sharp, Arctic, Midnight, Lime, Violet, Pineapple, Sunny[/b], [b]Dragonfruit [/b]and [b]Dread[/b] (if you dare).
<br />[*]Mix and Match bodies and wings as you like!
<br />[*]I do not claim to own nor have created the original Cazador texture (Bethesda/Obsidian), this is a recolour.

The Weapon Mod Menu 1.2.0
====================================================
By Pelinor for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[i]Thanks for voting for [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/filesofthemonth.php]FOTM[/url]! The Weapon Mod Menu was the #1 voted for November. The FOTM interview can be read [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/news/article.php?id=883]here[/url].[/i]


The Weapon Mod Menu replaces the existing menu when choosing to \"Mod Weapon\" in the PipBoy. You use it by pressing \"X\" as you normally would to open the mod menu.

There are four main features added by The Weapon Mod Menu:[list][*]Removal of attached weapon mods
[*]Specific information on the amount of improvement each mod gives
[*]Information about all of the weapon\'s mods, even if you don\'t own any of them
[*]The number of available mods in your inventory[/list]


See The Weapon Mod Menu in action with Gopher\'s [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRdpsOv2Kko]Fallout New Vegas Mod Clinic - Part 11[/url] and TheTuninator\'s [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=5_AWkNu2iSA#t=1784s]Fallout: New Vegas-Mods of the Week-Episode 31[/url].

A very special thanks goes to schlangster, who created the new NVSE functions that make this mod possible. (And for letting me have a sneak peek at them so I could have the mod ready when NVSE was updated.)
[line]


[size=5][color=#ffffdd][u]Requirements[/u][/color][/size][list][*]Fallout New Vegas
[*][url=http://nvse.silverlock.org]New Vegas Script Extender[/url] (NVSE) 2.0 beta 12 or higher
[*][url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901]Fallout Mod Manager[/url] (FOMM) for installation
- Optional -
[*][url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=42507]The Mod Configuration Menu[/url] (MCM) 1.4+[/list]


[size=5][color=#ffffdd][u]Installation[/u][/color][/size]
Manual installation is not supported for reasons of complexity. The Fallout Mod Manager (FOMM) installer will be the only supported installation method. See the included readme if you need detailed instructions.


[size=5][color=#ffffdd][u]Updating[/u][/color][/size]
[color=#FF0000]IMPORTANT:[/color] A problem with the version 1.0 FOMod prevents it from being updated correctly. You will need to fully remove it first.[list][*]Launch FOMM
[*]Select \"Package Manager\"
[*]Select The Weapon Mod Menu and \"Deactivate\"
[*]Right-click The Weapon Mod Menu and \"Delete\"
[*]Install the new version[/list]


[size=5][color=#ffffdd][u]Compatibility[/u][/color][/size][list][*]FOOK 0.80\'s \"Repair In Combat\" feature can prevent The Weapon Mod Menu from working when you press the \"X\" key. You can get around the issue by going into the MCM options for FOOK and enabling the \"Repair In Combat\" option. If it\'s already set to enabled, disable and enable it again. Then save your game, [b]quit to desktop[/b], and it should work when you load the save again.
[*]No other compatibility issues are known or expected.[/list]


[size=5][color=#ffffdd][u]F.A.Q.[/u][/color][/size][list][*]Q. Does this mod work with WME, WMX, or others that add weapon mods?
[*]A. Yes. This mod was designed to be universal and apply to any weapon that can be modified without needing compatibility patches.

[*]Q. Does this mod work with DarNified UI fonts?
[*]A. Yes. The menu will check for DarN fonts and adapt accordingly.

[*]Q. Why does my game crash when trying to mod a certain weapon?
[*]A1. This can happen (even without this mod) when you try to mod a weapon that uses mods from a plugin that is no longer in your load order. Remove any weapon mods added by WME, WMX, etc. from weapons before disusing those plugins.
[*]A2. This can also happen if you have an error in the weapon form. Load your mods with [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703]FNVEdit[/url] and look for any errors in the weapon. One or more of the weapon\'s mods could be trying to use invalid FormIDs.

[*]Q. Why am I told a weapon \"cannot be modified\" even though I know it can?
[*]A. See the answer above to crashing when modifying certain weapons.

[*]Q. Does this mod have controller support?
[*]A. Yes, although with limited functionality. You will be able to modify your equipped weapon if you press \"X\" on your keyboard, which works even when using a controller. You can close the menu with the \"E\" or \"X\" keys.

[*]Q. Why can I not interact with any mods that are grey?
[*]A. This happens when you don\'t have any of the mod items in your inventory. You will be able to see the mod information, but not interact with them.

[*]Q. Why does my character equip the weapon every time I want to mod it?
[*]A. The unique nature of the weapon mod functions requires the weapon to be equipped for them to work. It is also necessary to re-equip any equipped weapons after modding so the weapon model is updated.

[*]Q. I deactivated The Weapon Mod Menu, so why can\'t I use \"X\" to mod weapons like before?
[*]A. You need to uninstall The Weapon Mod Menu to return to using the default menu. The menu files are altered to prevent the default menu from opening when the new one is open.

[*]Q. Why does nothing happen when I press \"X\" in my inventory?
[*]A. There is likely an error in your menu files. Completely uninstall the mod, download the latest version, and install it again.

[*]Q. Do you have plans for future updates?
[*]A. Not at the moment. I will consider requests/suggestions, though.

Two Perks per Level 0.0.0-
====================================================
By Xodarap777 for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[url=http://xfo-nv.com][center][font=impact][size=8][color=ff1111][u]XFO-NV.COM[/u][/color][/font][/size][/center][/url]

Gives you two perks per level.  Not such a cheat, really -- there are too many perks to choose from, especially if you add more perks to the game (eg, see XFO Perk Paths at http://newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=39051).  More customization!

From the XFO Package at XFO-NV.com -- Not even yet implemented into the main package!  ... Still in alpha; feedback is much appreciated!

From the readme at XFO-NV.com (go there for updates and details!):

Now you can gain TWO perks per level! While it may sound like cheating, most never thought that when they went from a perk every two levels to a perk every level. The wasteland is harsh, and perks are fun. Plus, there are so many perk-adding modules (like my own \"perk paths\" above! :P), it can feel overwhelming to choose and underwhelming how many perks you get. I like it. If I get requests, I\'ll add a retroactive module (this one only works on levels gained after installation). Similarly, I can add a 3 Perks per level version, etc. Depends on demand ;)

NOTE: Not recommended for use with Swift Learning, at any rank. I\'ve put in a check, so if you have swift learning, you may simply lose a little xp each time you gain an extra perk, but not necessarily, and shouldn\'t be much at all (whatever passes over the new-level mark will be lost).

Unique Think Tank  Members 1.1.0
====================================================
By polferrera for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

This started as a retexture for my personal use, as I've never found any Think Tank or Roboscorpion retextures. I do have plans to redo a few more of Old World Blues' enemies, architecture, and overall textures, but, tbh, I'm just releasing this because of my gf's insistence (bless you Su)
<br />
<br />[b]What this mod does (as in v.1.1)[/b]
<br />
<br />- Gives each member of the Think Tank a unique appearance with higher resolution monitors included, as well as higher detailed brains and removes the colored glows that their tanks emit for a more realistic feeling (because crazy floating brains in jars need a dose of realism amr?)
<br />
<br />-Also gives Dr. Mobius a more unique look inspired by his human form
<br />
<br />[s]- An optional Roboscorpion retexture that gives them a Rusted metallic texture. I do like the original red yellow and green one, as I think the developers were going for an old Sci-fi vibe, but I just wanted something...different.[/s]    [b]NOW RELEASED AS A STANDALONE MOD![/b]
<br />
<br />-Retextures the Saturnite artillery shells found all over Big MT, Saturnite and regular Howitzer ones (wich means the Howitzer shells at Nellis will also be retextured)
<br />
<br />-Gives each facility's entrance sign a more crispy, sharp look
<br />[b]
<br />What this mod doesn't do:[/b]
<br />
<br />-Your taxes
<br />-Give your life meaning
<br />-Make Gabe's story any less sad.
<br />
<br />[b]FUTURE PLANS:[/b]
<br />
<br />- Retexture the dome architecture
<br />[s]- Give Dr. Mobius a more ''unique'' look, as opposed to just a broken brainbot  [/s]  Done as in version 1.05!
<br />[s]-Give EACH Think Tank member their unique appearance [/s]Done as in version 1.1!
<br />- Test and prod the Mojave. WITH SCIENCE[b]﻿

Unofficial Patch Plus - Addendum 0.0.0-2.04
====================================================
By PushTheWinButton for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[center][color=#fff2cc][size=6][b]Unofficial Patch  Plus[/b][/size][/color]
<br />[size=3][color=#999999]Requirements:
<br />All Official DLC[/color]
<br />[url=http://nvse.silverlock.org/]New Vegas Script Extender[/url]
<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277/?]JIP LN NVSE Plugin[/url][/size][/center]
<br />
<br />[line]
<br />[color=#fff2cc][size=5][b]Description[/b][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Unofficial Patch Plus, UP+ or UPP for short, is the premier compilation of supplementary bug-fixes for Fallout: New Vegas, which are not included in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51664/?]Yukichigai Unofficial Patch[/url] for one reason or another. Mostly this is because the fixes require NVSE, and YUP follows a philosophy that it should only require the official game and nothing else.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]As of version 2.0 UPP is separated into two modules, the first of which contains bug-fixes for elements of the vanilla game only. The second 'addendum' file contains fixes for continuity errors and oversights on the part of the devs, as well as a few other features.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3][u][b]This mod is not a replacement for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51664/?]Yukichigai Unofficial Patch[/url]; it is intended to be used in addition to it.[/b][/u][/size]
<br />
<br />[center][b][u][size=4]Main File[/size][/u][/b][/center]
<br />
<br />[size=3]UPP's main file is for bug-fixes, including updated and improved equivalents to the following mods. I won't reiterate what each of them do here as the original descriptions probably do them more justice. I suggest you check them out for more information.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3][b]Using any of the included mods alongside UPP is not recommended, as it may lead to conflicts and/or duplicate effects.[/b][/size]

<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Also, fixes new for UPP are as follows:[/size]
<br />
<br />[list]
<br />[*][size=3]Repair Kits have been (properly) fixed for weapons with durability mods, and they also play a sound effect, increment the "Items Repaired" stat, and are not consumed when you have no weapon equipped or your weapon is at full health.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]The "Stimpak's Taken" stat will increment if you use a Stimpak other than the regular variant, e.g. Super Stimpaks or Auto-Inject Stimpaks. This even affects Stimpaks added by other mods.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]The broken DT multiplication effect from OWB's Big Brained and Brainless perks has been properly fixed. The Marked perk from Lonesome Road is also covered [i](fix contributed by [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showuser=337763]miguick[/url]﻿)[/i].[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Added the vanilla sunguard effect (+1 PER) to some items which logically should have it, and that aren't covered by YUP: Construction Hat, Fire Helmet, Legion Centurion Helmet, Legion Explorer Hood, NCR Trooper Helmet, Police Hat.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Swapped 'EnchFourEyesGlasses' effect on some headgear for the unused vanilla 'EnchFourEyesHat' effect, so that the items also give sunguard's +1 PER when you don't have the Four Eyes Trait. The items covered by this are: Legion Prime (Decanus) Helmet, Legion Recruit (Decanus) Helmet, Legion Veteran (Decanus) Helmet, Legion Vexillarius Helmet, NCR Goggles Helmet, NCR Military Police Helmet.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]XP rewards for all the official DLCs have been corrected so that the originally intended total XP is awarded. Some missing rewards have also been re-added.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]The Professional perk has been changed to correctly 'catch' mod-added weapons which should be affected by it, but haven't been added to the correct form list.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Correctly implemented the broken vanilla Companion Suite perk, which was intended to add abilities for companions as well nerf them slightly.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]High value items should now actually reach their base value, rather than being a handful of caps below.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Fixed Freeside Bodyguards being attacked by Securitrons when approaching the gate to the Strip [i](fix contributed by [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showuser=2783618]Axonis[/url])[/i].[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]The original Weathered 10mm Pistol will be automatically replaced with YUP's fixed version when you equip it (as some mods place it in the world, and so circumvent YUP's fix).[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Changed the value of Gecko Steak from 5 to 4 so that it matches the meat, as is the case with every other steak item.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Fixed a bug with the quest objectives in By a Campfire on the Trail if the player approaches the Xander Root after already crafting the Healing Powder [i](fix contributed by [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showuser=2783618]Axonis[/url]).[/i][/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Minor name fixes (e.g. "Pre-war Money" corrected to "Pre-War Money").[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Added the "Glasses" slot flag to Goggles Helmet so it can no longer be equipped with a pair of glasses in order to get the Four Eyes effect twice.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Retrieving more than 3 items from a Mojave Express Box now displays a single message, instead of spamming a message for each item. The script has also been modified so that it only counts playable items [i](fix contributed by [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showuser=2783618]Axonis[/url])[/i].[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]A couple of miscellaneous form list additions, including some weapons missing from the Grunt perk list, and some items missing from animation lists.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Added option to use a customisable hotkey to control the Friend of the Night perk's effects. The effects now fade in and out too, rather than just pinging on and off as they did in vanilla. (This feature is disabled by default; use MCM to assign a hotkey.)[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Added a customisable hotkey to immediately cancel VATS playback, for those situations when it bugs and leaves you vulnerable for long periods of time.[/size]
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />[center][b][u][size=4]Addendum File[/size][/u][/b][/center]
<br />
<br />[size=3]UPP's addendum file includes fixes for continuity errors and logical oversights. For example, a character may mention something related to the game world which isn't actually the case; or certain items may have a certain trait or use, whereas similar items do not. This file aims to fix these sorts of errors, though they technically aren't bug-fixes. This optional (but recommended) add-on can be found in the optional files section of the downloads.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]The mods that are included:[/size]
<br />
<br />[list]
<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/41217/?]Dead Money - Christine Has More Skills[/url] by Yukichigai[/size]
<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62618/?]Euclid C-Finder NVSE Upgrade[/url] by Nekhanimal and miguick [i](x10 damage increase only)[/i][/size]
<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61638/?]Ghoul Rad Tweaks[/url] by miguick [i](included the Feral Ghoul Reavers' gore grenade, as in Fallout 3)[/i][/size]
<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61706/?]Lobotomite Tweaks[/url] by miguick;[/size]

<br />[*][size=3]The radio in the Novac motel room changed to Mojave Music Radio, as it previously received the (mostly-silent) REPCONN launch station [i](fix contributed by [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showuser=2783618]Axonis[/url]).[/i][/size]
<br />[/list]

<br />[size=3]The following fixes are no longer included in UPP as they are now included in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51664/?]Yukichigai Unofficial Patch[/url] or better implementations have been accomplished in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277/?]JIP LN NVSE Plugin[/url] or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66347]lStewieAl's Tweaks[/url].[/size]

<br />
<br />[center][b][u][size=4]Project Nevada Patch[/size][/u][/b][/center]

<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />[size=3]You will be notified if any of the NVSE dependencies are missing.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3][url=https://www.moddb.com/mods/vanilla-ui-plus]Vanilla UI Plus[/url] by axonis is also highly recommended as it fixes several bugs with the vanilla interface and generally improves its usability for modern displays.[/size]
<br />
<br />[line]
<br />[color=#fff2cc][size=5][b]Load Order[/b][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Load this mod after YUP, and high up in your load order. The addedum file should be placed after the main file, if you use it. If possible, load both files after YUP's NPC fixes file, although don't worry too much about doing this as the effects of any possible conflicts are minor. You can always use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34703/?]FNVEdit[/url] to patch these if you wish.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]If you're using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61592?]JSawyer Ultimate Edition[/url], load UPP before it. If you're also using Project Nevada, and the associated patches, your load order should be as follows:[/size]

<br />[color=#fff2cc][size=5][b]Uninstallation[/b][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[size=3]This mod can be uninstalled at any time and will have no permanent effects on your game.[/size]
<br />
<br />[line]
<br />[color=#fff2cc][size=5][b]Compatibility[/b][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Many fixes included in UPP are scripted and so will not conflict with anything in most cases. Loading UPP high will mean other mods will 'win' where the two mods change the same record, which will avoid most problems, even though it means you'll lose UPP's fix. I recommend that mod authors copy forward fixes from UPP in the same way as they would for YUP.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]If you use a mod which includes a fix which is also replicated in UPP, you may see duplicate effects. For example, if you use another mod which adds the missing Sierra Madre return recipes, there will be two sets of recipes in the menu. The only way to fix these issues is to use a compatibility patch, or for the other author to simply remove the fix so there's no issue to begin with.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Preferably I'd want to avoid making loads of compatibility patches as these take time to make and just clutter load orders and cause confusion. I'd rather this mod become the 'hub' for such fixes and for other mod authors to delegate them to UPP, in much the same way as YUP is considered the de-facto bug-fix mod for conventional bug-fixes. That way, it's simpler for everyone.[/size]
<br />
<br />[line]
<br />[color=#fff2cc][size=5][b]Suggestions[/b][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[size=3]I'm happy to take suggestions for changes which should be included in UPP, just be prepared to justify your reasoning. Also keep in mind that I want to keep this as purely bug-fixy as possible, and not stray too far into gameplay changes.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]If you think a certain fix shouldn't have been included in UPP then you're free to explain why, and I'll take it on board. Just keep things civil, ok?[/size]

Unofficial Patch Plus 2.14.0
====================================================
By PushTheWinButton for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[center][color=#fff2cc][size=6][b]Unofficial Patch  Plus[/b][/size][/color]
<br />[size=3][color=#999999]Requirements:
<br />All Official DLC[/color]
<br />[url=http://nvse.silverlock.org/]New Vegas Script Extender[/url]
<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277/?]JIP LN NVSE Plugin[/url][/size][/center]
<br />
<br />[line]
<br />[color=#fff2cc][size=5][b]Description[/b][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Unofficial Patch Plus, UP+ or UPP for short, is the premier compilation of supplementary bug-fixes for Fallout: New Vegas, which are not included in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51664/?]Yukichigai Unofficial Patch[/url] for one reason or another. Mostly this is because the fixes require NVSE, and YUP follows a philosophy that it should only require the official game and nothing else.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]As of version 2.0 UPP is separated into two modules, the first of which contains bug-fixes for elements of the vanilla game only. The second 'addendum' file contains fixes for continuity errors and oversights on the part of the devs, as well as a few other features.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3][u][b]This mod is not a replacement for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51664/?]Yukichigai Unofficial Patch[/url]; it is intended to be used in addition to it.[/b][/u][/size]
<br />
<br />[center][b][u][size=4]Main File[/size][/u][/b][/center]
<br />
<br />[size=3]UPP's main file is for bug-fixes, including updated and improved equivalents to the following mods. I won't reiterate what each of them do here as the original descriptions probably do them more justice. I suggest you check them out for more information.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3][b]Using any of the included mods alongside UPP is not recommended, as it may lead to conflicts and/or duplicate effects.[/b][/size]

<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Also, fixes new for UPP are as follows:[/size]
<br />
<br />[list]
<br />[*][size=3]Repair Kits have been (properly) fixed for weapons with durability mods, and they also play a sound effect, increment the "Items Repaired" stat, and are not consumed when you have no weapon equipped or your weapon is at full health.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]The "Stimpak's Taken" stat will increment if you use a Stimpak other than the regular variant, e.g. Super Stimpaks or Auto-Inject Stimpaks. This even affects Stimpaks added by other mods.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]The broken DT multiplication effect from OWB's Big Brained and Brainless perks has been properly fixed. The Marked perk from Lonesome Road is also covered [i](fix contributed by [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showuser=337763]miguick[/url]﻿)[/i].[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Added the vanilla sunguard effect (+1 PER) to some items which logically should have it, and that aren't covered by YUP: Construction Hat, Fire Helmet, Legion Centurion Helmet, Legion Explorer Hood, NCR Trooper Helmet, Police Hat.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Swapped 'EnchFourEyesGlasses' effect on some headgear for the unused vanilla 'EnchFourEyesHat' effect, so that the items also give sunguard's +1 PER when you don't have the Four Eyes Trait. The items covered by this are: Legion Prime (Decanus) Helmet, Legion Recruit (Decanus) Helmet, Legion Veteran (Decanus) Helmet, Legion Vexillarius Helmet, NCR Goggles Helmet, NCR Military Police Helmet.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]XP rewards for all the official DLCs have been corrected so that the originally intended total XP is awarded. Some missing rewards have also been re-added.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]The Professional perk has been changed to correctly 'catch' mod-added weapons which should be affected by it, but haven't been added to the correct form list.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Correctly implemented the broken vanilla Companion Suite perk, which was intended to add abilities for companions as well nerf them slightly.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]High value items should now actually reach their base value, rather than being a handful of caps below.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Fixed Freeside Bodyguards being attacked by Securitrons when approaching the gate to the Strip [i](fix contributed by [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showuser=2783618]Axonis[/url])[/i].[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]The original Weathered 10mm Pistol will be automatically replaced with YUP's fixed version when you equip it (as some mods place it in the world, and so circumvent YUP's fix).[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Changed the value of Gecko Steak from 5 to 4 so that it matches the meat, as is the case with every other steak item.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Fixed a bug with the quest objectives in By a Campfire on the Trail if the player approaches the Xander Root after already crafting the Healing Powder [i](fix contributed by [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showuser=2783618]Axonis[/url]).[/i][/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Minor name fixes (e.g. "Pre-war Money" corrected to "Pre-War Money").[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Added the "Glasses" slot flag to Goggles Helmet so it can no longer be equipped with a pair of glasses in order to get the Four Eyes effect twice.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Retrieving more than 3 items from a Mojave Express Box now displays a single message, instead of spamming a message for each item. The script has also been modified so that it only counts playable items [i](fix contributed by [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showuser=2783618]Axonis[/url])[/i].[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]A couple of miscellaneous form list additions, including some weapons missing from the Grunt perk list, and some items missing from animation lists.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Added option to use a customisable hotkey to control the Friend of the Night perk's effects. The effects now fade in and out too, rather than just pinging on and off as they did in vanilla. (This feature is disabled by default; use MCM to assign a hotkey.)[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Added a customisable hotkey to immediately cancel VATS playback, for those situations when it bugs and leaves you vulnerable for long periods of time.[/size]
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />[center][b][u][size=4]Addendum File[/size][/u][/b][/center]
<br />
<br />[size=3]UPP's addendum file includes fixes for continuity errors and logical oversights. For example, a character may mention something related to the game world which isn't actually the case; or certain items may have a certain trait or use, whereas similar items do not. This file aims to fix these sorts of errors, though they technically aren't bug-fixes. This optional (but recommended) add-on can be found in the optional files section of the downloads.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]The mods that are included:[/size]
<br />
<br />[list]
<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/41217/?]Dead Money - Christine Has More Skills[/url] by Yukichigai[/size]
<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62618/?]Euclid C-Finder NVSE Upgrade[/url] by Nekhanimal and miguick [i](x10 damage increase only)[/i][/size]
<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61638/?]Ghoul Rad Tweaks[/url] by miguick [i](included the Feral Ghoul Reavers' gore grenade, as in Fallout 3)[/i][/size]
<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61706/?]Lobotomite Tweaks[/url] by miguick;[/size]
<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64022/?]Lonesome Road Carbon Shadow Fix[/url] by AgeofEvolutionHQ;[/size]
<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40866/?]Loyals Detonator Can Detonate Explosives[/url] by Yukichigai;[/size]

<br />
<br />[list]
<br />[*][size=3]Trudy's radio changed to play Radio New Vegas, as she refers to Mr New Vegas in her dialogue [i](fix contributed by [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showuser=2783618]Axonis[/url])[/i].[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]The radio in the Novac motel room changed to Mojave Music Radio, as it previously received the (mostly-silent) REPCONN launch station [i](fix contributed by [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showuser=2783618]Axonis[/url]).[/i][/size]
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />[center][b][u][size=4]Superseded Fixes[/size][/u][/b][/center]
<br />
<br />[size=3]The following fixes are no longer included in UPP as they are now included in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51664/?]Yukichigai Unofficial Patch[/url] or better implementations have been accomplished in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277/?]JIP LN NVSE Plugin[/url] or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66347]lStewieAl's Tweaks[/url].[/size]

<br />
<br />[center][b][u][size=4]Project Nevada Patch[/size][/u][/b][/center]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Project Nevada does it again with its needlessly complex changes... The supplied patch makes UPP's changes to the Y-7 Implant work alongside Project Nevada, in addition to patching conflicting aid items.[/size]

<br />
<br />[size=3]I highly recommend that you use the following bug fix mods alongside Unofficial Patch Plus. These mods are either too complex to include, or are relatively new and I haven't found time to include them yet. Please read the mod authors' descriptions for yourself to understand what they each do.[/size]

<br />[*][size=3]All Official DLC[/size]
<br />[*][size=3][url=http://nvse.silverlock.org/]New Vegas Script Extender[/url];[/size]

<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />[size=3]You will be notified if any of the NVSE dependencies are missing.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3][url=https://www.moddb.com/mods/vanilla-ui-plus]Vanilla UI Plus[/url] by axonis is also highly recommended as it fixes several bugs with the vanilla interface and generally improves its usability for modern displays.[/size]
<br />
<br />[line]
<br />[color=#fff2cc][size=5][b]Load Order[/b][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Load this mod after YUP, and high up in your load order. The addedum file should be placed after the main file, if you use it. If possible, load both files after YUP's NPC fixes file, although don't worry too much about doing this as the effects of any possible conflicts are minor. You can always use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34703/?]FNVEdit[/url] to patch these if you wish.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]If you're using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61592?]JSawyer Ultimate Edition[/url], load UPP before it. If you're also using Project Nevada, and the associated patches, your load order should be as follows:[/size]

<br />[line]
<br />[color=#fff2cc][size=5][b]Uninstallation[/b][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[size=3]This mod can be uninstalled at any time and will have no permanent effects on your game.[/size]
<br />
<br />[line]
<br />[color=#fff2cc][size=5][b]Compatibility[/b][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Many fixes included in UPP are scripted and so will not conflict with anything in most cases. Loading UPP high will mean other mods will 'win' where the two mods change the same record, which will avoid most problems, even though it means you'll lose UPP's fix. I recommend that mod authors copy forward fixes from UPP in the same way as they would for YUP.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]If you use a mod which includes a fix which is also replicated in UPP, you may see duplicate effects. For example, if you use another mod which adds the missing Sierra Madre return recipes, there will be two sets of recipes in the menu. The only way to fix these issues is to use a compatibility patch, or for the other author to simply remove the fix so there's no issue to begin with.[/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]Preferably I'd want to avoid making loads of compatibility patches as these take time to make and just clutter load orders and cause confusion. I'd rather this mod become the 'hub' for such fixes and for other mod authors to delegate them to UPP, in much the same way as YUP is considered the de-facto bug-fix mod for conventional bug-fixes. That way, it's simpler for everyone.[/size]
<br />
<br />[line]
<br />[color=#fff2cc][size=5][b]Suggestions[/b][/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[size=3]I'm happy to take suggestions for changes which should be included in UPP, just be prepared to justify your reasoning. Also keep in mind that I want to keep this as purely bug-fixy as possible, and not stray too far into gameplay changes.[/size]

Update 2_5 0.0.0-
====================================================
By thaumx Mkageyama for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

WARNING: This mod contains nudity. It replaces the default body with a nude version that has a detailed texture. It also animates breasts causing them to move, and replaces most female armors with versions that are skimpier and/or sexier, and also may display nudity. If this not for you, or you are not legal age to use this mod in your country, please do not install it or complain about it! You have been warned.
<br />
<br />UPDATE - 08/2012
<br />Let me apologize to everyone for the lack of support for this mod over the last year and a half. I've been traipsing around to locations with little to no internet connectivity. Because of that, I had to cut short some improvements I had been planning, and focus on just getting a "complete" mod done without the extra options. (more clothing support for different body types, and a more "realistic"/less sexy version of the clothing. Along with a few other supported things.) While I'm still quite busy at the moment, I'm hoping to be able to do some more work to this mod. -Thaumx
<br />
<br />I am pleased to introduce the Bouncing Natural Breasts mod for Fallout New Vegas. This mod represents literally months of effort on the part of several authors. While this mod’s primary authors are Thaumx and Mkageyama, It is important to know that we have in several areas built on the efforts of mod creators who came before us. (With appropriate permissions!) So please see the credits section which lists everyone’s contributions.
<br />
<br />COMPLETE DESCRIPTION IN THE README! Readme contains installation instructions, troubleshooting, credits, etc.
<br />
<br />PLEASE DOWNLOAD ALL THREE MAIN FILES. README is in BNB_BODY
<br />
<br />Features
<br />
<br />•   Complete Body Replacer - this mod replaces the default female body to a larger-breasted BNB version. The new mesh and textures provide a realistic (for the game engine) nude body.
<br />
<br />•   Animated Breasts - this mod replaces the default skeleton with a version that includes breast bones. All the meshes (including armor!) have been weighted to the bones so that they work with the complete set of replaced animation files. This means female model breasts will bounce and sway when walking, running, jumping, dancing, etc.
<br />
<br />•   Armor Replacer - this mod replaces all but the most obscure female armors (over 90% of female armors!) with armors that match the BNB body. These armors are skimpier and sexier, and have animated breasts.
<br />
<br />•   Old Woman Sanitizer™ - this mod uses an additional armor set to keep old women wearing the default Fallout armors. No more grandmas in skimpy clothing! It also uses two separate bodies for “Old” and “OldAged” women, as well as a separate texture for the oldest women.
<br />
<br />•   Specialty Armors – this mod includes a few specialty armors that are available for free in Goodsprings. They are found in Victor’s shack in the “BNB Wardrobe” and will respawn every 3 days.
<br />
<br />•   Instructions are included to convert YOUR armor to the BNB skeleton. 
<br />
<br />•   Reworked animations - All the standard animations like walking, sneaking, jumping, swimming, and even the “prostitute dance” have been redone to include moving breasts.  Little things have been included as well, like having breasts hang more vertical away from the body when leaning forward sneaking .
<br />
<br />NOTE: Please check the troubleshooting section BEFORE posting a problem in the comments section. You'll most likely get your issue resolved quicker that way :)

Using the console doesn&amp;#39;t disable achievements 1.0.0
====================================================
By gibbed for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

Recently started replaying Fallout: New Vegas, and was mildly annoyed that using the console disabled achievement unlocking. I put together a simple plugin for NVSE to patch the game to allow it.<br /><br />This was made for the latest version of the game, 1.4.0.525 (and only this version).

Van Graff Overhaul 1.4 1.4.0
====================================================
By Gildemer for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

The Van Graffs are a powerful merchant family that trades high end goods such as energy weapons and gold, they also are capable of fielding a small but well equipped mercenary army. 
<br />
<br />This mod aims to better represent the VanGraffs wealth and influence with the following changes:
<br />
<br />- It reworks the Silver Rush inside and out to make it seem more like the establishment of an important merchant family. On the outside the big windows are removed, since they don't appear on the inside of the store. Also some barricades have been placed at the door to give the guards some cover. The upper floor has been rebuilt and now houses some employees, that take care of the energy weapons, as well as an additional guard. On the inside the furniture of the old casino has been removed and replaced by a new set up. Blue neon lights and some Van Graff themed decoration have been added and the empty tables and shelfs in the store have been filled up with goods (not to brake the games balance by offering to much loot in one small space I heavily decreased the health of the weapons).
<br />
<br />-It gives the Van Graff mercenaries a new combat armor with the Van Graff family symbol (inspired by Fallout Van Buren) and matching black berets.
<br />
<br />- It replaces most mercenarie's plasma rifles with laser rifles (even for a family as rich as the Van Graffs equipping all their mercenaries with plasma seems a little much, also the laser rifle fits the dark uniform better).
<br />
<br />If you install this mod and then load a save, in which you already have visited the silver rush, the new equipment wont show on the mercenearies. Just open the consol, click on them and enter the command "resurrect", this will reset the npcs with all the new gear.
<br />
<br />[b]Updates
<br />
<br />[/b]Version 1.1 - Gets rid of a problem with the placement of the guards during the Van Graff intro.
<br />
<br />Version 1.2 - Fixes the texture problem with the armor, beret and flags. Also fixes the beret go-mesh.
<br />
<br />Version 1.3 - Fixes the problems the mod caused with the quest Birds of a Feather.
<br />
<br />Version 1.4 - Adds a new outifit for Gloria and a Van Graff salvaged power armor. This armor is ether in Jean-Baptistes room or can optionaly be worn by him.

Well Rested Overhaul 1.0.0
====================================================
By Migck for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[size=6][b][center][font=Trebuchet MS][i][color=#ff7700][u]Well Rested Overhaul[/u][/color][/i][/font][/center][/b][/size]
<br />
<br />[size=3]REQUIRES... you know what, screw it, I'm not listing requirements here anymore. Check the tab for them or get bent.
<br />
<br />
<br />The Well Rested buff, a nice idea, though kinda half baked. It lasts 1440 seconds of "real" time, which, when adjusted for a default timescale of 30, gives 12 hours of game time with it... but of course, that starts to fall flat when using a different timescale. Plus, there's the tiny detail of that duration being the same no matter how long you hit the sack. Just rest for 1 hour in your owned bed, enjoy 12 of being Well Rested, rinse and repeat. And finally, pretty much all the "hot coffee" action you can engage in the standard game ends up giving pretty much nothing in return... just a black screen, a few lost game hours, and some cheesy moans if at all.
<br />
<br />In this mod, I've addressed all these issues:
<br />[/size][list]
<br />[*][size=3]Well Rested's duration is no longer tied to the scripted effect itself, instead it is controlled as a quest variable. The mod registers at which hour you enter sleep, and if you're under the effect of the vanilla well rested effect when waking up, calculates the duration under which you'll be under the Well Rested perk buff as (hours slept x 1.5) &lt;= 12h. Thus, to get a full Well Rested buff, nothing beats sleeping in an owned/special bed for a full 8 hours, which, you know, is the mainstream magic number of sleep time (personally, I need at least 12, but then I'm a friggin sleep cripple, like that jackass Little Buster). You can also see the Well Rested perk in the pipboy tab, with the number of hours left for it to expire in its description.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]Well Rested provides some additional effects beyond a 10% increase in earned XP, which is kinda useless once you hit the level cap. So in addition to it, you also gain +10% to your accuracy with firearms, action point regeneration rate, and attack speed. A good sleep is good for your nerves and muscles.[/size]
<br />[*][size=3]And finally, all the sex scenes (I hope) now can grant the Well Rested buff, as well as having the player actually sleep through them and lowering his Sleep Deprivation in hardcore mode, instead of just having the clock skip a few hours. So now you have no excuse to smash at Vault 21 with Ms. Weintraub (don't forget the oil), or to take Red Lucy head on once you fulfill her "alpha hunter" fetish, plus you now get something out of abusing Joana other than being a bloody bastard. These three encounters will grant you 3 hours of sleep, 4.5 hours of well rest bonus. So will the services of the Casa Madrid professionals (Jimmy, Maude and Sweetie). As for Dazzle in the Gomorrah, and Beatrix Russell, Santiago and Fisto in the Atomic Wrangler, purchasing their (cheap) services will grant you 1 hour of sleep and 1.5 of well rest. You may now proceed with complaints about the "objectification" and "gamification" of sex. I care, really.[/size]
<br />[/list][size=3]
<br /> As a side effect, the duration of the vanilla Well Rested actor effect is reduced to a token 10 seconds and is in fact dispelled ASAP. Bear this in mind, because it might cause conflicts I'm unaware of. As asafeguard, if the actor effect is applied by some other mod when mine has no starting hour of sleep registered, you'll be granted 12 hours of Well Rested by default.
<br />
<br />Install/uninstall by enabling/disabling the 'migWellRested.esp'.[/size]

Beyond the Beef Tweaks 1.4.0
====================================================
By Asterra for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[color=#00ff00][size=5]Beyond The Beef Tweaks[/size][/color]
<br />
<br />[u][color=#f4cccc][size=4]This mod makes a[/size][/color][/u][u][color=#f4cccc][size=4] few small changes to the Beyond The Beef quest aimed at improving options and making the conclusion more fulfilling.[/size][/color][/u]
<br />
<br />
<br />[size=3]Things this mod changes:
<br />
<br />[/size][list]
<br />[*][color=#e06666][size=3][b]The dialogue option to offer your companion as a replacement is now permanently available until the quest concludes.  Normally, this dialogue option disappears for good once you agree to Mortimer's initial proposal, cutting the option off.[/b][/size][/color]
<br />[/list][color=#e06666][size=3][b]
<br />[/b][/size][/color][list]
<br />[*][color=#e06666][size=3][b]When you offer your companion as a replacement, the quest now updates to reflect that optional task.[/b][/size][/color]
<br />[/list][color=#e06666][size=3][b]
<br />[/b][/size][/color][list]
<br />[*][color=#e06666][size=3][b]The quest no longer outright completes the moment you let Mortimer know that you have trapped your companion in the freezer.  This change enables one to frame Heck Gunderson for murder [i]as well as [/i]offer one's companion for the banquet -- these two options are normally mutually exclusive, as the quest ends with either one.[/b][/size][/color]
<br />[/list][color=#e06666][size=3][b]
<br />[/b][/size][/color][list]
<br />[*][color=#e06666][size=3][b]If you complete the quest in Mortimer's favor, you are now made an honorary member of the White Glove Society on the spot, and are given the membership key and formal wear that you normally only get from Marjorie.  This also means that you may freely join the exclusive members-only banquets at 7pm, including the first one where Mortimer makes his revelation speech.  Without this change, the only way to become an honorary member and gain access to the banquets is by working [i]against[/i] Mortimer.[/b][/size][/color]
<br />[/list][color=#e06666][size=3][b]
<br />[/b][/size][/color][list]
<br />[*][color=#e06666][size=3][b]If you are made an honorary member of the White Glove Society (by Mortimer [i]or[/i] Marjorie), picking up the food and drink found at the members-only banquets no longer counts as stealing.[/b][/size][/color]
<br />[/list][color=#e06666][size=3][b]
<br />[/b][/size][/color][list]
<br />[*][color=#e06666][size=3][b]If you complete the quest in Mortimer's favor, the amuse-bouche appetizers available at the banquet will be "Strange Meat Pie" rather than "Imitation Strange Meat Pie."[/b][/size][/color]
<br />[/list][size=3]
<br />In a nutshell, when playing through this quest, I had three goals: Make Heck Gunderson pay dearly for callously strong-arming his way to riches, rid myself of Veronica in the most elaborate way the game allows, and attend the banquet where she is the main event.  Naturally, when I discovered that there were unnecessary shortcomings in the quest that prevented me from doing all three of these things together, I took it upon myself to correct this.  The members-only banquet is filled with honorary members, so it felt like a rip-off and a legitimate oversight that the player was not instantly awarded a seat at the banquet they were responsible for enabling, as did the fact that even if they [i]were[/i] a member, all of the food was off-limits.  A well-done quest deserves special attention to push it closer to perfection, and these are changes that I consider essential to that aspiration.
<br />
<br />[color=#ff0000]V1.1[/color], by request, eliminates some ITM records and removes unneeded dependencies.  Functionally, it is no different.
<br />[color=#ff0000]V1.2[/color] fixes a bug that permitted a dialogue option to appear too early.

Zan AutoPurge Crash Protector - New Vegas Edition 1.2.0
====================================================
By ZanGS and Luke Gevaerts for Fallout:	New Vegas 
====================================================

[heading]Warning[/heading]<br />Consider the release of this plugin to be something akin to a public beta test. I&#39;ve taken it through the entire game, the DLCs and a number of user-created plugins without running into any problems, but with a game as unstable as this one you never really know. Run with it, and let me know how it worked out for you in the comments.<br /><br />[heading]Description[/heading]<br />ZanGS&#39; [url=http://fallout3.nexusmods.com/mods/14575]Zan AutoPurge Crash Protector[/url] plugin has proven to be very effective at stabilizing Fallout 3&#39;s performance. As Fallout: New Vegas is just as unstable as its predecessor, I decided to port the plugin, adapt it and see if it would make just as big a difference as it did in Fallout 3 - and it does. I&#39;ve cleaned up the code and made it compatible with The Mod Configuration Menu, but the real mojo comes from [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/users/415567]ZanGS[/url] - so please direct your appreciation to the latter. As stated in the small description, this plugin has been ported with permission.<br /><br />You can use The Mod Configuration Menu to tune the various purge delays (exterior, interior, menu, idle) as well as plugin feedback (do or don&#39;t display a message on purge) to your liking. You can also use it to enable and/or disable the system; this functionality should have been present in the initial release, but I somehow managed to overlook it. Take a moment to throw a kudo [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/users/1711335]AltDunmer[/url]&#39;s way for not only alerting me to the problem but also providing me with a quick fix.<br /><br />[heading]Purpose[/heading]<br />This plugin handles the purging of cell buffers, cleaning up and reducing the amount of information stored in RAM - which ultimately prevents the game from crashing as often as it normally would. It&#39;s especially effective when used in combination with high-resolution texture packs, but it can still make a notable difference when used by itself.<br /><br />[heading]Requirements[/heading]<br />[list][*]Fallout: New Vegas[*][url=http://nvse.silverlock.org/]New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE)[/url][*][url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/42507]The Mod Configuration Menu<br />[/url][/list]<br />[color=#444444].[/color]<br />You don&#39;t actually need The Mod Configuration Menu to be able to [i]use[/i] this plugin; it has been supplied with a set of default values to work with. You do need it to [i]configure[/i] said values, however - but why [i]wouldn&#39;t[/i] you use The Mod Configuration Menu? Go get it&#33;<br /><br />[heading]Installation[/heading]<br />Unpack the archive into the game&#39;s data directory, and use your plugin manager of choice to include [b]Zan_AutoPurge_SmartAgro_NV.esp[/b] in your load list. To deinstall, remove the plugin from the load list and delete [b]Zan_AutoPurge_SmartAgro_NV.esp[/b] from the game&#39;s data folder.<br /><br />[heading]Compatibility Issues[/heading]<br />There should be none; feel free to let me know if there are.<br /><br />[heading]Changelog[/heading]<br />1.2:<br /><br />- Increased the time window for all purge options.<br /><br />1.1:<br /><br />- Added the ability to enable and/or disable the purging system, courtesy of [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/users/1711335]AltDunmer[/url].<br /><br />1.0:<br /><br />- Initial release.
